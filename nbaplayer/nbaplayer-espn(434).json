This makes the third time in the last four games that Dunleavy was brought off the bench. O'Brien insists both players can start or come off the bench, depending on the matchup that particular night. For fantasy players in daily leagues, look at the Pacers' opponent. If there's a scorer at shooting guard -- say, Kobe Bryant, Dwyane Wade or Jason Richardson -- O'Brien will want Rush's defense in the starting lineup. Otherwise, you can expect Dunleavy to start (32.5 mpg as a starter)."
