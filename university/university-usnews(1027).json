            "Our distinctiveness begins from our mission: \"Adrian College, a liberal arts College in the United Methodist tradition, is committed to the pursuit of truth and to the dignity of all people. Through active and creative learning in a supportive community, students are challenged to achieve excellence in their academic, personal, and professional lives, and to contribute to a more socially just society.\" More recently, our Ribbons of Excellence grew from our mission. In 1887, the seniors presented a cane, symbolic of leadership and hard work, to the junior class officers. It has been handed down every year by since, and each class attaches a ribbon.  In 2007, our academic community adopted the idea of the ribbons to represent standards of excellence. These new \"ribbons of excellence\" are: 1) Caring for humanity and the world: making socially responsible decisions; providing service to local and global communities; interacting positively with persons of diverse cultures and backgrounds. 2) Learning throughout a lifetime: continuing to ask important questions; pursuing knowledge in each new age; remaining open to new learning experiences. 3) Thinking critically: developing critical habits of mind; exploring multiple points of view; raising thoughtful questions, identifying problems and solutions. 4) Crossing boundaries and disciplines: developing literacy in multiple fields; personifying the liberal arts experience; making connections across disciplines. 5) Developing creativity: engaging in creative arts; developing creative talents and skills; recognizing and employing figurative expression.  These permeate our campus culture, especially on Ribbons of Excellence Day as campus and community convene to celebrate scholarly and creative activities of our students. \r\n\r\nAdrian College offers numerous enriching educational experiences. Almost one quarter of last year's graduating class studied abroad. Many academic programs require internships or practicums, giving students opportunities to apply their studies in real-world situations. Many courses are designed around service learning. Examples include Biology students working with the River Raisin Watershed Council, Teacher Education students tutoring at local schools, and Business students consulting for local non-profits. All majors require a Capstone Experience, where seniors synthesize years of learning into a single project. We have also been the recipient of Fulbright Arabic Scholars for the past three years, enriching our language offerings and campus culture. Adrian College is also proud to participate in Operation Education, a program that helps wounded veterans earn an education. \r\n\r\nAdrian College is experiencing tremendous growth through its Renaissance campaigns, which continue to transform our teaching, learning, and scholarly environments. Renaissance I brought new athletic facilities, including a multisport performance stadium and ice arena, and new programs, including a marching band and the Athletic Training Program.  Renaissance II is bringing innovative educational opportunities. For example, Rush Hall was transformed from an old bookstore to the home of the Communication Arts and Sciences program, complete with new media studios, sound rooms, and editing labs, and we have invested in several technology initiatives, including smart classrooms, digital library resources, Blackboard, and a significant increase in our Internet bandwidth to 90Mbps max throughput.\r\n\r\nRenaissance II also prompted the creation of Institutes, which integrate theoretical and practical learning in distinctive ways. These are the Institute for Entrepreneurial Studies, the Institute for Health Studies, the Institute for Study Abroad, the Institute for Ethics, and the Institute for Law and Public Policy. Institutes promote interdisciplinary learning, seek unique opportunities for students, give a platform for student-faculty collaboration, and foster projects that benefit our campus culture."

            "Alice Lloyd journeyed from Boston to Kentucky in 1915, seeking a milder climate in which to recover from her failing health.  In the Appalachian Mountains, she found that education became her life's work.  She truly believed that these hills and hollows held the leaders of tomorrow. Thus, Alice Lloyd College (ALC) was born.\r\nFrom its inception, Alice Lloyd College has placed a supreme value on educating the whole person. The name of the community, Pippa Passes, originated from a poem by Robert Browning called \"Pippa's Song\". Pippa was a poor mill child who passed through the surrounding villages singing lyrics that ultimately changed the troubled lives of the people she encountered. This great work became a symbol for one of the purposes of Alice Lloyd College: the influence of unconscious good upon the world.\r\nIt was Alice Lloyd and co-founder June Buchanan who saw the spirit of learning prevail both in and out of the classroom, forming the basis of character education. The \"Christian Forum\" required students to discuss ethical and moral issues, life's purposes and goals, and Christian standards of conduct. These values were all significant in the total educational experience. Leadership was the desired result of character building.\r\nToday, this tradition remains a central focus of Alice Lloyd College. It is reflected in the leadership of its faculty and staff; Student Work Program; Caney Convocation Series; a special leadership course required of freshman students; and high standards of conduct, dress, and attitude.\r\nStudents and parents alike are reminded of the College's philosophy during orientation sessions. It is expected that students who have engaged in the Alice Lloyd College experience will not only be intellectually equipped to continue their pursuit of learning, but will also be prepared as responsible citizens for a life of service and leadership.\r\nThe idea of working for an education at ALC is as old as the school itself.  Early students provided labor in exchange for tuition, room, and board. They were earning their own way on the path of becoming the leaders of tomorrow. Today, tuition is guaranteed to qualified students residing in 108 Central Appalachian counties in parts of five states. At Alice Lloyd College, every full-time student is required to work as a part of his or her overall educational experience.  So committed is the College to the concept of student leadership, that successful completion of the work assignment is a graduation requirement. \r\nAlice Lloyd College provides a comprehensive leadership development program for its students. This training contains aspects of leadership philosophy, citizenship, and cultural development, which build upon a strong traditional liberal arts education. The institution attempts to infuse leadership education initiatives into all aspects of the educational experience including formal classroom instruction; activities that enable students to experience cultures outside of Appalachia; group learning activities; involvement in service to others; and activities that place them in leadership roles. \r\nTo accomplish this ideal, the Academic, Student Services, and Work Program have become intimately connected in pursuing the mission of preparing leaders to serve Appalachia through a formal leadership development program. Through the years, Alice Lloyd College has impacted many lives, and in turn, those people have become leaders in their communities and the region serving in roles such as doctors, lawyers, ministers, political leaders, and educators. \r\nAlice Lloyd College has been marketed as a college that is Providing Leadership for Appalachia."

            "UNUSUAL COMBINATIONS.  At Allegheny, we feel so strongly about unusual combinations that they are built right into our curriculum: We're one of the few liberal arts colleges nationally that will ask you to choose a minor as well as a major. Does this make school more difficult? In some ways it probably does. But we find that our students love the challenge. A nationally known residential college of liberal arts and sciences, Allegheny is a unique place where students embrace the College's total educational experience. Our 2,100 students have the uncanny ability to create unusual combinations of interests, skills, and talents. These \"wonderfully weird\" combinations enhance our students' success here and ensure excellence in their future careers. For example, Allegheny students might study political science as they prepare for medical school. They might take ballroom dancing, participate in varsity basketball, and conduct lab research???all in the same week. The classroom experience is enhanced by nationally recognized programs such as the Center for Political Participation, the Center for Experiential Learning, and the Center for Economic and Environmental Development, which offer students powerful and engaging out-of-classroom experiences. With more than 900 unique combinations of majors and minors, and a capstone comprehensive senior project, Allegheny students can explore all of their interests. Our undergraduate residential education prepares young adults for successful, meaningful lives by promoting students' intellectual, moral, and social development and encouraging personal and civic responsibility. Allegheny's faculty and staff combine high academic standards and a commitment to the exchange of knowledge with a supportive approach to learning. Students thrive in the unusual combinations culture, developing highly valued abilities to explore critical issues from multiple perspectives. Graduates are equipped to think critically and creatively, write clearly, speak persuasively, and meet challenges in a diverse, interconnected world. The nation's 32nd oldest college, Allegheny is known for its rich history, stunning campus, and professors who not only know students by name but also take pride in their students' success. Our students often work side by side with faculty on research and creative projects that are often reserved only for graduate students at other colleges and universities."

            "Alvernia University is a private Franciscan institution rooted in the Catholic and liberal arts traditions, offering more than 50 undergraduate programs of study, seven masters degrees, five graduate certifications, four graduate dual programs, and one doctoral degree. More than 2,850 traditional day, evening undergraduate, and graduate students are enrolled across three Pennsylvania locations and at numerous off sites. Alvernia, which acquired university status in September of 2008, was founded as a liberal arts college in 1958 by a Catholic order of women, the Bernardine Franciscan sisters, who emigrated from Eastern Europe to Eastern Pennsylvania to teach the families of immigrant miners more than 100 years ago. Their values of social justice and peacemaking are at the core of their academic program. In this tradition, education is not about knowledge merely for its own sake, but about applying ideas in service to others. They foster moral leadership and service in the interest of peace and justice, locally and globally, challenging students to grow personally and to achieve their calling in life as teachers, nurses, business executives, psychologists, parents, athletes, lawyers, historians, and more, preparing graduates for life and work in a world calling for civic engagement and moral leadership. In 2008 they received the prestigious Community Engagement Designation from the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. In 2009 they were named to the  President???s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll for exemplary service efforts and service to America???s communities by the Corporation for National and Community Service. Their flagship undergraduate programs include criminal justice, business, education, and nursing, and, on the graduate level, the master in business administration and the master in education.  Alvernia???s First-Year experience for incoming freshmen and their intervention efforts to keep students on track academically was twice recognized by the National Resource Center for the First-Year Experience:  as a semi-finalist in 2005 and as a full awardee in 2006, with the First Year Student Advocate Award, given to Alvernia???s Dean of Academic Advancement, only one of 10 such awardees nationally. New programs and community initiatives are being launched by the Holleran Center for Community Engagement and the Center for Ethics and Leadership, building on existing efforts in civic engagement, ethics, and leadership; serving as incubators for innovation; and fostering expanded faculty and student collaboration. The Holleran Center for Community Engagement (HCCE) is an emerging catalyst for creating strategic community partnerships and for establishing Alvernia as a regional leader in community-based learning. The HCCE strengthens student learning by making the community an essential part of the curriculum and, at the same time, helps improve the quality of life in its local and regional communities. The Center for Ethics and Leadership (CEL) promotes inquiry and reflection concerning the ethical dimension of leadership and the leadership implications of important ethical issues. The CEL seeks to strengthen campus intellectual life and help foster community growth and awareness concerning issues of ethics and leadership. The strength of Alvernia???s faculty regarding ethics and leadership education has resulted in programs to develop leaders in the for-profit and non-profit sectors and new public events and programs addressing ethical issues. In March of 2007, Alvernia completed a new strategic plan and launched its first ever comprehensive master plan which will mean $25-30 million of capital improvements to the Reading campus over the next 10 years. In 2008, Alvernia celebrated its golden anniversary--50 years of preparing graduates to achieve their personal dreams and professional success, to be engaged citizens and lifelong learners."

            "Students at American University benefit from the school’s location in the political hub of the nation. Washington, D.C., is a playground for the politically and socially oriented with its countless museums, restaurants, clubs, and year-round events. The university, located in a suburban pocket of northwest Washington, is close to a stop on the D.C.-area Metrorail transit system. Rides downtown take about 15 minutes. Students at American have been rated among the most politically active in the nation, and there are more than 300 student clubs and organizations on campus. The school also has a sizeable Greek system, with about 30 fraternities and sororities. The American University Eagles sports teams compete in the NCAA Division I Patriot League, and the school’s mascot is, accordingly, an eagle. Catching a professional sports contest, such as a Redskins football game or a Nationals baseball game, is a quick trip from campus, too. Freshmen do not have to live on campus, though most choose to do so. The university is affiliated with the Methodist church, but its Kay Spiritual Life Center houses 25 groups of different faiths. The confluence of opportunities on and off campus clearly works for most students:  American University boasts a notably high freshmen retention rate close to 90 percent."

            "Outstanding Qualities\r\nAppalachian State University aspires to be a model 21st-century, nationally recognized university that combines the best characteristics of liberal arts and research institutions by resourcefully blending teaching and scholarship. \r\n\r\nWe are committed to attracting, educating, and graduating the best students and to producing the highest levels of scholarship. \r\n\r\nOur mid-sized enrollment, rural location, and quality of academics create a unique environment for student and faculty engagement. \r\n\r\nIn many ways, we combine the best of a small liberal arts college (e.g., close relationships among students, faculty, and staff) and a large research university (e.g., breadth of programming and scholarship). \r\n\r\nOffering more than 140 undergraduate and graduate degree programs, Appalachian attracts students from 45 states and more than 54 foreign countries. We emphasize \"a community of learners,\" a challenging academic environment in which students and faculty together ask questions, explore ideas, cultivate understanding, examine what they believe and delve into new possibilities.\r\n\r\nEight academic colleges form our undergraduate and graduate degree offerings:  Arts & Sciences, Business, Education, Fine & Applied Arts, Health Sciences & Allied Professions, Music, University College, and Graduate Studies & Research.\r\n\r\n A nationally recognized first-year experience program combines a variety of programs and experiences \"both inside and outside the classroom\" that prepare students to live and work in today's complex network of local, regional, and global communities.\r\n\r\nExchange programs with 41 universities in 17 countries make Appalachian part of the global academic family. More than 600 students explored the world in the 2009-10 academic year through study abroad opportunities, selecting from more than 60 Appalachian overseas education programs. The Institute of International Education ranks Appalachian sixth in the nation among master's degree granting institutions for undergraduates studying abroad.\r\n\r\nMore than $14 million in research and service grants and contracts was awarded to the university during the 2009-10 academic year. Our faculty mentor students in research and creative endeavors. \r\n\r\nLocated at 3,333 feet in the Blue Ridge Mountains of northwestern North Carolina, Appalachian provides a favorable location for learning to occur. The campus shares an aesthetically pleasing, culturally and recreationally rich mountain environment - all combine to attract a faculty, staff, and student population seeking a high quality of life.\r\n\r\nWe value our unique location - we have a genuine respect for the natural environment and a commitment to principles of sustainability. We have a \"green energy\" plan and a sustainability council, both of which seek to inform, educate, promote, and protect the natural environment.\r\n\r\nOur students support the campus through the Renewable Energy Initiative (REI), which supports projects related to energy conservation, energy efficiency and renewable energy.\r\n\r\nNew degree programs with an emphasis in sustainable development are further examples of our commitment to educating future generations about the importance of planning and promoting environmental best practices."

Our students have studied in Australia, Chile, China, Costa Rica, England, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, and Spain, among other locations. Assumption College???s highly selective Honors Program enables outstanding students to immerse themselves in their individual academic interest/major in creative and personal ways.\r\n\r\nThere is a culture of mentorship within the Assumption community that helps each individual develop a personal compass and find his or her path in life.

            "Auburn, Ala., has been ranked one of the best places to live, and life at Auburn University can be similarly enjoyable for students. Football is a particularly big attraction in the fall, as fans support the Auburn Tigers with the help of school mascot Aubie the Tiger. The Tiger sports teams compete in the NCAA Division I Southeastern Conference, and the influx of football fans makes Auburn the fifth-largest city in the state on game days. Pep rallies are held in the downtown Toomer’s Corner, and the area is covered in toilet paper by fans after every big victory. There are more than 300 organizations on campus, and about 6,000 students are involved in the school’s Greek system. Auburn freshmen ease into the college transition through Camp War Eagle, a three-day, overnight summer orientation program. Transition help continues on Hey Day, an annual effort to get students to wear name tags and say hello to one another. Freshmen do not have to live on campus; in fact, a dorm room isn’t even guaranteed. Because of space restraints, first-year students are awarded on-campus living assignments on a first-come, first-served basis."

            "Augustana College, founded in 1860, is a selective, private, residential, comprehensive college (liberal arts and professional) of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.  Challenging academics, a friendly, vibrant community and reasonable cost come together to create an exceptional value for our 1750 students.  The Augustana community (faculty, alumni, students, administrators, and staff) strives to embody Five Core Values: 1) Christian - As a college of the church, we welcome all faiths, encourage spiritual growth, and relate Christian faith and ethics to learning and service.  2) Liberal Arts - Augustana provides an education of enduring worth by affirming that teaching and learning are central and life-long; the breadth of our curriculum provides students with the skills and flexibility necessary for successful careers in a complex world. 3) Excellence - Engaged students, great teaching, high standards, and integrity lead to successful outcomes. 4) Community - Augustana fosters an environment of participation, caring, respect, and empowerment.  5) Service - Students enter to learn and leave to serve.  \r\n\r\nThe heart of the Augustana experience is a rigorous academic program taught by a remarkable collection of professors.  All are passionate about their disciplines and their teaching. Publishing, conducting research, and attaining national prominence have helped to create the rich liberal arts environment that exists on campus today. Over 80 per cent of Augustana???s full-time tenured and tenure-track professors hold the highest degree in their field.  The College offers over 50 majors and pre-professional specializations within a 4-1-4 academic calendar.  Extensive internship, study-abroad and undergraduate research programs supplement the curriculum.  Civitas, the College???s honors program, provides an environment for students who desire an even more challenging and rigorous intellectual experience.\r\n\r\nLocated in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, a city of 156,000 and one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in America, Augustana is in a prime location for anyone wishing to live in a great small city that offers valuable experience in their field before graduation.  Sioux Falls is the business, health care, research, shopping, entertainment, sports, and cultural center of the region. Our largest employers include Sanford Health, Avera Health, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and the Sioux Falls School District.   The city is also home to four semi-professional sports teams: the Canaries (baseball), Storm (arena football), Stampede (hockey), and SkyForce (basketball).  These organizations represent a small sampling of the many internships, practicums, and part-time jobs that enhance and support the education of Augustana students. For example, our students may join scientists from around the world at the EROS Data Center to work on United Nations projects and to study satellite imagery or do cancer research with a physician at Sanford Health. \r\n\r\nFor outdoor recreation enthusiasts, Sioux Falls has a fantastic 20-mile bike trail that loops around the city following the Big Sioux River, with several adjoining public parks. Great Bear Recreation Park offers downhill and cross-country skiing as well as snowboarding in the winter and hiking trails in the summer. Sioux Falls is also home to a number of golf courses, a water park, and of course, Falls Park, the city's namesake. Finally, South Dakota is known for its spectacular hunting and fishing. \r\n\r\nAugustana participates in NCAA Division II athletics in the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference and has recently made over $16 million in improvements to its athletic facilities.  Students are involved in outstanding performing and visual arts programs, campus ministry, service learning, student leadership, environmental awareness, and more."

            "Few schools the size of Austin College offer a greater emphasis on all things global, highlighted by a nationally recognized study abroad program. Three-quarters of the Class of 2009 studied abroad while attending Austin College, and an average 70 percent of students in the past 10 years have studied abroad, exploring more than 50 countries on 6 continents. In fact, Austin College has been ranked #1 in the nation 4 of the past 6 years by the Institute of International Education for percentage of study abroad participation among liberal arts colleges. Study abroad takes many forms at Austin College, including January Term, internship programs, and service opportunities such as the new Global Outreach summer program that has sent students on self-designed international service projects in Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, India, Kenya, Lebanon, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, and Vietnam. In 2010 alone, Austin College students once again furthered their educations on nearly every continent, including North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. For January Term, students visited 25 countries on 5 continents-all except Australia and Antarctica. Austin College biology professor George Diggs covered the coldest continent with a January sabbatical trip to Antarctica, where his research involved capturing videos of penguins, leopard seals, and humpback whales, as well as photos of animals and a small tuft of grass he found on the Antarctic Peninsula."

The university respects the voice and value of every member of its learning community. Students, faculty, and staff from throughout the world enrich the liberal arts experience. This rich variety of thought and life experience fosters a deeper understanding of our own and other cultures. Undergraduate programs in the liberal arts and sciences and in pre-professional and professional programs are the nucleus of the university.

The liberal arts core provides for all students a broad, multicultural foundation in literature, the arts, history, mathematics, and the natural and behavioral sciences. Graduate programs serve the needs of the region and provide advanced experiences for students preparing for doctoral studies. The graduate programs demand a superior level of academic achievement requiring scholarship, independent judgment, academic rigor, and intellectual honesty. The educational experience is complemented and expanded through creative use of technology, interdisciplinary programs, team teaching, cooperative learning, community services, international programs, and collaborative research between faculty and students. Co-curricular experiences provide each student with resources and guidance that enhance academic success, further career goals, and promote intellectual and personal growth. The university provides programs to help students clarify values, develop physical well-being, work independently and collaboratively, and participate in shared governance. Centers of Excellence in the Creative Arts and Field Biology as well as Chairs of Excellence provide unique learning opportunities. Both the main campus and the Austin Peay Center at Fort Campbell serve a diverse student body with complete academic programs. Off-campus and distance learning facilities offer curricula to expand the reach of the university to populations not easily served on traditional campuses. The university enriches the traditional instructional program through close interaction with the surrounding community. The university provides programs, services, and facilities that contribute significantly to the intellectual, economic, social, and cultural development of the region. Austin Peay remains committed to the education of a non-racially identifiable student body and promotes diversity and access without regard to race, gender, religion, national origin, age, disability, or veteran status.

            "Avila's path began in 1650 in LePuy, France.  Guided by a belief in the dignity of every individual, the original six Sisters of Saint Joseph had the courage to respond to the needs of others around them.  They nursed the sick and helped the homeless.  With this commitment to one???s neighbors, the Sisters of Saint Joseph founded Avila in 1916 as the College of St. Teresa.  When the college expanded to a larger campus in 1963, its name was changed to Avila to honor St. Teresa of Avila.  In 2002, Avila College became Avila University, a name reflecting its growth and development as an institution of higher education. Avila University's commitment to excellence, to service of students and the community, to quality education of spirit, mind and body, and to the growth of the whole person is deeply rooted in its Catholic heritage and in the lives and beliefs of the founding Sisters. Today, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet sponsor Avila and serve as constant reminders of the University's mission.  Avila???s 50-acre campus is located on the historical Santa Fe Trail in beautiful south Kansas City, Missouri.  Nestled in a quiet neighborhood, members of the Avila community not only enjoy the benefits of its suburban location, but also its easy access to Kansas City highlights.  Known for its jazz district and world-famous barbecue, Kansas City is home to professional sports teams, premier shopping districts, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, and the American Royal.  The City of Fountains, as Kansas City is known, is a major Midwest travel destination.\r\nAvila's campus is made up of 11 buildings, including three residence halls, a multi-million dollar renovated field house, a sports complex, theatre, library, chapel, and classroom facilities.  Recent building additions and renovations include a suite-style residence hall and expansion of the nursing laboratory facilities.  Avila University provides an educational experience rooted in the Catholic tradition and in the spirit of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, both of which emphasize collaboration, examination of social issues, responsiveness to the needs of others, and respect for the worth and dignity of each individual.  An Avila education balances general knowledge with specialized skills, learning to think critically, and putting that thinking into practice.  Avila students travel to Mexico to build houses for poor families, conduct health assessments for children in inner city schools, debut award-winning films, and create web pages for high profile clients like Rollingstone.com.  Avila believes that real-world learning becomes real-life achievements.  The faculty is committed to excellence in teaching.  Research and publication are also valued especially when collaboration of students and faculty is involved.  The Avila University faculty is dedicated to life-long learning, professional growth and excellence in the classroom. Avila University nurtures cultural diversity which honors and draws upon the talents of all its students, faculty, and staff.  In the fall of 2009, thirty-five percent of new undergraduate students were members of minority groups, the highest of any school in the Kansas City metropolitan area.  Students are involved in a variety of activities on campus, including 40 student organizations, honor societies and student government.  Most majors offer a club or association that allow students to learn outside of the classroom setting, exchanging ideas and philosophies with peers, and providing a richer academic experience.  Opportunities for leadership exist as early as freshman year.  Nearly 85 percent of Avila's 13,000 alumni have chosen to stay and work in the greater Kansas City metropolitan area.  Avila alumni are leaders in their fields and continue the Avila tradition of \"serving the dear neighbor\" by serving in the communities in which they live."

            "Bard College’s setting is less like a typical campus than a vast village spread out across 500 acres of parks and woodland. Located in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., the secluded school is close to the Hudson River and the Catskill Mountains. Many students have views of the campus’s nearby scenery from their dorm rooms. First-year students must live in one of the campus’s 40 different residence halls and houses, some of which have “alcohol free,” “quiet,” and “wellness” themes. For outdoor recreation, students can go horseback riding, canoeing, hiking, and biking. There are more than 80 clubs on campus, and students are welcome to start new organizations. There is no elected student government at Bard, and no Greek system, either. More than half of Bard students study abroad before graduation. There are tons of student volunteer options, like the Bard Prison Initiative, a program that sends students to maximum- and medium-security jails throughout New York to tutor inmates. The Bard Raptors sports teams are members of the NCAA Division III Eastern College Athletic Conference. Freshmen at Bard start college earlier than their peers at most other schools, arriving in early August for a three-week orientation to campus, academic, and community life known as the Language and Thinking Program."

            "Women at Barnard College can experience two extremes of education—a small, liberal arts school and a large, coeducational Ivy League institution—all the while enjoying an urban lifestyle in New York City. Barnard is an all-female college in Manhattan with a partnership with the school across the street,", 
            ". Barnard women can take classes, play sports, and join organizations at Columbia University-—and Columbia students have the same opportunities at Barnard. The two schools are joined in an athletic consortium, and compete in the NCAA Division I Ivy League Conference. The school’s own mascot is a dancing Barnard Bear named Milly. Barnard College has about 80 of its own student organizations, though Columbia students often join, too. The Barnard Student Government Association does not recognize on-campus sororities, but women can join Columbia’s Greek organizations. Students call the school’s location in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of the Upper West Side home, as nearly 95 percent live on campus. Freshmen are not required to live on campus, but 98 percent choose to do so. The school’s Urban New York program takes first-semester students to free events around the city, and all Barnard women get student discounts on tickets to nearby on- and off-Broadway shows, various sporting events, and concerts. Barnard students also have year-round opportunities for internships in New York City, organized through the Career Development office."

            "Barton College strives to focus on individual learners and their personal relationship with learning. We believe that learning occurs best when students actively participate and interpret what they learn. Our students challenge, debate, and discuss ideas. Our professors are facilitators committed to helping students achieve their goals through a style of learning that best enhances their critical thinking and leadership skills as well as global/community awareness. At Barton, we intentionally challenge our students both in and out of the classroom. With that in mind, Barton's First-Year Seminar engages students academically and socially as they make the transition from high school to college. Freshmen share a common reading and intellectual experience through study and discussion of a summer reader; they share time, energy and enthusiasm for service-learning projects; and they begin to build a foundation for their academic pursuits through an exploration of the disciplines offered through our five academic schools: Arts and Sciences, Behavioral Sciences, Business, Education, and Nursing. Barton offers a wide variety of professional programs complementing the College's liberal arts core. Education K-6 and 6-9, education of the deaf and hard of hearing, nursing, gerontology, social work, athletic training, and mass communications are just a few of the 30 majors offered at Barton. We want Barton students to be learners prepared to contribute to the 21st century world community. Engaged learning is about students taking responsibility for their life and their education. At Barton, we encourage students to get engaged with what matters most in their life...their future."

            "Bates College—the first coeducational college in New England—is located in Lewiston, Maine, along the Androscoggin River. Its setting is favorable for outdoor enthusiasts; skiing, canoeing, beaches, Lake Auburn, and natural parks are all nearby. Approximately 95 percent of students live on campus in either a residence hall or one of Bates’ 25 Victorian homes, which house between 10 and 30 students each. Among the more than 110 student organizations are the Outing Club, which sponsors outdoor and adventure trips throughout the year; the Brooks Quimby Debate Council; and WRBC, the Bates radio station. About one-third of Bates students participate in varsity athletics, and the Bates Bobcats are members of the NCAA Division III New England Small College Athletic Conference."

            "The student community at Baylor University is bound together largely by religion and service. The Waco, Texas, school is a private, Baptist institution, and its student body is particularly active in volunteerism. Each semester, students donate a collective 12,000 hours of time to service projects. Students can volunteer year round through the school’s Urban Missions, which coordinates service projects in the local community, and Global Missions, which sends students abroad. The student body is also active in faith-based activities. Each year, students lead Be The Change, a week of speakers and break-out sessions and events that give religion a global focus. Freshmen are required to live on campus and must also take a semester of Chapel, attending worship services every Monday and Wednesday. Students and faculty gather daily for a campus prayer at noon, and weekly for free ice cream floats during “Dr. Pepper Hour.” Students can also get involved in more than 250 student organizations on campus. There are about 40 fraternities and sororities, and the organizations compete in their own intramural sports leagues. Baylor is the only private school in the NCAA Division I Big 12 Conference, but the sports teams, known as the Baylor Bears, stay competitive—especially in football. The school mascot, not surprisingly, is a bear. Baylor University also has its own holiday, Diadeloso, a day when classes are cancelled so students can participate in athletics tournaments, attend free concerts, and relax at a block party. Waco, which is 100 miles from Dallas and Austin, is a small city with outdoor recreation opportunities like hiking and mountain biking."

            "Our Mission: Edinboro University, a community where intellectual engagement and opportunity challenge and empower individuals.  We are inspired to serve and lead as active citizens of our global society through collaborative learning experiences emphasizing campus activities, community outreach, and practical applications.  These factors combine to ignite the excitement of discovery and create a thirst for life-long learning and a pursuit of excellence. Our Vision: To become an internationally recognized university known for its innovation, leadership, and commitment to excellence.  Our Values: Opportunity, Excellence, Respect, Integrity, Leadership. \"Great things happen here!\" is much more than a catchphrase or marketing tagline at Edinboro University.  It's more than a goal.  And it's more than a mere belief. Plainly stated, it's a fact. From the 800 members of our faculty and staff working together as a single team toward our students' excellence in academic attainment, extracurricular participation and leadership, to our outstanding reputation as a world-class institution of higher education, Edinboro University has become a 21st Century paradigm for post-secondary learning.  Edinboro's  faculty and staff have adopted the mantra of excellence in everything we do, from academics in more than 100 majors at the undergraduate and graduate levels, many of them nationally accredited, to athletics that include NCAA Division I wrestling, to scores of student intramurals and clubs and organizations, to just having fun in our recently renovated, 260,000 square-foot student centre. Our new $115 million, suite-style student housing complex offers many of the amenities students seek in today's residential college experience, and the new six-story Michael S. Zafirovski Sports and Recreation Center represents the largest free-standing domed facility of its kind in the tri-state region.  Our new Dr. William P. Alexander Music Center, and the soon-to-be constructed Human Services Building, along with the renovation of the Cooper Science Center, all point to a thriving institution in northwestern Pennsylvania where growth and achievement are the norm rather than the exception. But it's more than our 40 buildings, many with green and sustainable features, or our beautiful five-acre Mallory Lake, or even our 585-acre safe and aesthetically pleasing campus so conducive to study and academic attainment that make Edinboro University such a perfect match for over 8,200 residential, commuter and distance-learning students. In fact, we know that what  matters most to students and parents is that Edinboro University offers a value-added education from a renowned faculty dedicated to our students' success; an educational philosophy that prepares our students not only for their first jobs, but for their second and third jobs as well, and even for multiple careers in today's global marketplace.

Students admitted to the college have the opportunity to join more than 100 clubs or organizations but do not have a Greek system on campus. Elmira students voted out Greek life and, instead, host college-wide dances and social events. Students at Elmira College are required to live on campus throughout their college careers, and the college believes this helps cultivate close relationships and experiences. Students interested in exploring the city can walk to nearby downtown shops and restaurants or visit the Clemens Center, which hosts music performances, Broadway shows, and national entertainers. Known as the Soaring Eagles, Elmira College is a member of the Eastern College Athletic Conference, United Volleyball Conference, and the Empire 8 Conference in the NCAA Division III."

            "Emerson College is committed to excellence in education for communication and the arts. Since its beginning in 1880, the College has been a place for those unique students for whom thought and experience overlap: thinking is linked to doing. At Emerson, students discover their perspectives and put them to use. A rich liberal arts curriculum is paired with concentrated studies in communication sciences and the arts, giving students the perfect balance of knowledge and know-how. \r\n\r\nLocated on Boston Common in the heart of the city's Theatre District, the Emerson campus is home to WERS-FM, the oldest noncommercial radio station in Boston; the historic, 1,200-seat Cutler Majestic Theatre; and Ploughshares, the award winning literary journal for new writing. Emerson's 3,100 undergraduate and 900 graduate students come from across the United States and 50 countries. There are more than 80 student organizations and performance groups, 15 NCAA teams, student publications, and honor societies. The College also sponsors study and internship programs in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.; study abroad in the Netherlands, Taiwan, and Czech Republic; and course cross-registration with the six-member Boston ProArts Consortium. \r\n\r\nEmerson students have access to the highest quality visual and media arts equipment, including sound-treated television studios, digital editing labs, audio post-production suites, film screening room, sound stage, and a professional marketing suite/focus group room. There are seven on-campus facilities and programs to observe speech and hearing therapy, an integrated digital newsroom for aspiring journalists, and an 11-story performance and production center which houses performance and rehearsal space, a theatre design/technology center, makeup lab, and costume shop. There is a fitness center, athletic field, and new gymnasium and campus center. Current construction projects include the building of a permanent home in Hollywood for the College's Los Angeles study and internship program."

Its beautiful 17-acre campus is neighbored by a world-class medical center, two major art museums and Fenway Park. Its unique location allows students and faculty opportunities to explore real-world experiences through internships, research and strategic partnerships within the Longwood Medical Area and the city of Boston.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel is a community with a lifelong passion for teaching and learning rooted in the commitment to rigorous intellectual inquiry and the pursuit of social justice. Today, Emmanuel College continues to embrace its founding mission to transform lives and make a better world.\r\n\r\nAs a liberal arts and sciences college, Emmanuel enables students to cultivate both the means of acquiring and evaluating knowledge and the imagination to shape new and alternative ways of perceiving, thinking and creating. At Emmanuel College, students develop their intellectual potential, their strong sense of self and their commitment to serve others in the community. They become critical thinkers, ethical decision makers and contributing members of society.\r\n\r\nBy offering a variety of career-oriented programs informed by the liberal arts disciplines, the College prepares students for professional fields and develops the skills and knowledge that can be applied to diverse and changing circumstances. The link between the liberal arts and career-oriented programs at Emmanuel reflects the College's sense of responsibility to students who desire to create lives of meaning and service; to identify their changing talents and concerns; to maintain the analytical, communicative and creative skills necessary for growth; to discern worthwhile work; and to bring ethical standards and moral sensitivities to all endeavors."

            "The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington is a distinctive public liberal arts college where coordinated, team-taught, interdisciplinary programs - combining a range of topics around a central theme - replace disconnected courses.  Faculty members write narrative evaluations to assess student work, rather than reducing performance and progress to a letter grade.  The curriculum promotes engagement and collaboration, rather than competition.  Students have the freedom, and accountability, to design their education to meet their personal and career goals, without the limits of formalized majors or rigid requirements.  The curriculum is redesigned every year, and upper division students can propose individual learning contracts to further customize their learning experience.\r\nWhile in many ways Evergreen breaks the mold of traditional higher education - and in doing so opens up opportunities for students with a wide range of learning styles and career goals - the college delivers a high level of academic rigor.  The National Survey of Student Engagement, sponsored by the Pew Charitable Trusts, notes that Evergreen students tend to read more, prepare more extensively for class, make more presentations and engage more actively with faculty and each other than at the vast majority of colleges and universities nationwide.  Students have opportunities for research, hands-on field study, community service, internships and study abroad.  \r\nEvergreen is one of just three institutions on the West Coast included in the book \"Colleges That Change Lives\" by former New York Times education editor Loren Pope.  Pope notes that at these colleges, \"Learning is collaborative rather than competitive; values are central; there is a strong sense of community.  They are places of great synergy, where the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts.  Aspirations are raised, young people are empowered.\"\r\nEvergreen is located in the vibrant state capital of Olympia.  Students can easily access the urban life of Seattle or Portland, or the recreational opportunities of the Pacific Ocean, Mount Rainier and the Olympic National Park, all within a one- to two-hour drive.\r\nEvergreen's forested 1000-acre campus features a half-mile of saltwater beach on Puget Sound, a Native American longhouse, an organic farm, and award winning, environmentally friendly architecture in its newest classroom and office complex.  With a strong commitment to sustainability in operations, curriculum and policy, Evergreen has been noted as one of the nation's top 'green' colleges.\r\nThe vast majority of Evergreen's 4700 students are undergraduates studying the liberal arts and the sciences, including natural and physical sciences.  The college also offers graduate programs in Education, Environmental Study, Public Administration, and Teaching."

            "Fairfield University is a Jesuit and Catholic University that was established in 1942 and is rooted in one of the world's oldest intellectual and spiritual traditions. Fairfield prepares students for leadership and service in a constantly changing world through broad intellectual inquiry, the pursuit of social justice, and cultivation of the whole person: body, mind, and spirit.  Located just 60 miles outside New York City, in the heart of a region where the future takes shape, more than 5,000 undergraduate and graduate students from 36 states and 39 foreign countries are enrolled in the University's six schools.  The comprehensive core curriculum, 35 undergraduate majors, 36 graduate programs, 20 Division I athletic teams, and more than 100 student organizations offer a wide range of opportunities for research, internships, service, and civic engagement.  When considering an applicant for admission, Fairfield looks at measures of academic achievement, students' curricular and extracurricular activities, their life skills and accomplishments, and the degree to which they have an appreciation for Fairfield's mission and outlook.  Students are challenged to be creative and active members of a community in which diversity is encouraged and honored. With its commitment to education for an inspired life, Fairfield has developed a unique educational model to ensure that students receive the motivating guidance they need to reach their fullest potential. The integration of living and learning is at the heart of a Fairfield education.  Students learn what it means to be a fully engaged member of the campus community by participating in a living and learning community based on their interests. Students have ample opportunities for vocational exploration when their studies begin to focus around the questions, \"What really interests me? What do I really feel drawn to?\" Students are encouraged  to explore civic engagement and their own role in the larger world - applying what has been learned and \"giving back.\" Finally, full integration of all learning opportunities begins to occur as they discern how they want to put their gifts and education to work in the world. As a result of this holistic model of education, Fairfield graduates have been highly successful in gaining admission to selective graduate schools, while others go on to achieving successful and satisfying careers.  A significant achievement for Fairfield University is that 55 Fairfield graduates have been tapped as Fulbright scholars since 1993."

            "Fairleigh Dickinson University is dedicated to the preparation of world citizens through global education. Founded in 1942, Fairleigh Dickinson has grown into the largest private university in New Jersey, with more than 12,000 students. The University offers more than 100 undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degree programs. In addition to its two campuses in New Jersey (the Metropolitan Campus in Teaneck, N.J., and the College at Florham in Madison, N.J.), FDU was the first U.S. university to own its own overseas campus when it opened Wroxton College in England in 1965. In 2007, FDU opened its newest campus in Vancouver, Canada, to primarily serve international students. The University enjoys a long tradition of overseas programs and partnerships, as well as international student enrollment, with today more than 1,000 students from over 80 countries. Among many highlights that support the University's global mission, FDU's first Core course is the Global Challenge, which introduces students to global education and to critical global issues. FDU features online study with Global Virtual Faculty (GVF) - now more than 60 scholars and professionals from around the world who partner with FDU faculty and, via the Internet, bring diverse international perspectives to students. Building on a close partnership with the United Nations, the University created the U.N. Pathways Forum and more than 70 ambassadors and international officials have visited the University since the program began in 2002. The University also regularly broadcasts videoconferences from the United Nations to our campuses and other universities. In addition, Fairleigh Dickinson has earned designation as a nongovernmental organization (NGO) affiliated with the U.N.'s Department of Public Information, and students and faculty enjoy special access to U.N. resources, people and programs. FDU also is the first university to gain special consultative status as an NGO with the U.N. Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). Faculty members have since gained appointment to many U.N. committees focusing on a wide variety of international issues."

            "Florida Southern College is a rapidly rising star among the nation's best private colleges. With a mission to prepare students to make consequential contributions to our world, the College enrolls 1832 full-time residential undergraduate students from 44 states and 31 countries on its scenic, 100-acre campus. Nationally recognized for its focus on engaged learning, FSC guarantees every student an internship and study abroad experience, and provides students with numerous opportunities for student-faculty collaborative research, performance, and service learning. With so many opportunities to prepare for the world beyond college, it is no surprise that 94% of graduates report landing great jobs in their fields or continuing their studies at prestigious graduate schools within three months of graduation. \r\n\r\nFSC offers more than 50 dynamic majors in fields such as art, biology, business, communication, education, environmental studies, music and theater performance, nursing, and psychology. Pre-professional programs include pre-medicine, pre-pharmacy, pre-dentistry, and pre-law. Distinctive master???s programs also are offered in business, nursing, and education. \r\n\r\nThe College's commitment to engaged learning is reflected in its 12:1 student-to-faculty ratio and a faculty excited about providing students with personalized, hands-on learning both in and out of the classroom. Examples include student entrepreneurs working with TOMS Shoes to distribute shoes for homeless children; marketing students assisting Chinese executives with the expansion of a Hong Kong theme park; horticulture students developing some of the world???s first virus-free roses; computer science students designing robots to enhance teaching; education students honing their skills at the College???s Preschool and Kindergarten Lab Schools; and voice students performing alongside members of the famed Metropolitan Opera. \r\n\r\nAn innovative new program-the Junior Journey-guarantees all entering students the opportunity to study domestically or overseas at no cost other than minimal course credit charges. Nearly 50% of FSC students study abroad and credit their travel experience with expanding their world view. A group of students tutored impoverished children in Honduras this year during spring break. Others are pursuing engaged learning in China and Hong Kong, England, France, Italy, and Spain. Semester programs are offered in England, Germany, Mexico, Northern Ireland, and Spain. \r\n\r\nThe facilities at Florida Southern-designed by internationally acclaimed architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright and Robert A.M. Stern-are world class. A state-of-the-art, 24/7 technology center just opened, as have modern residence halls featuring bedrooms with stunning views of Lake Hollingsworth. A new classroom building, to include a language lab, film studies center, and art gallery, opens in fall 2010. Other new facilities are the cyber caf?? serving Starbucks in the library, the dining hall, a cutting-edge nursing building, and the Water Dome, also designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. \r\n\r\nOur involved students enjoy outstanding student life programming that includes championship NCAA Division II events in 18 sports, intramurals, more than 70 clubs and organizations, a volunteer-oriented Greek system, and popular weekend programming. The free lakefront program features kayaks, canoes, and sailboats. \r\n\r\nOne visit to Florida Southern is all it takes to see why our students say we're a college \"On the Move!\" Great academics, a dynamic student life culture, exceptional campus beauty, and the success of our graduates are just a few of the reasons top college guides such as The Princeton Review and the Fiske Guide to Colleges tout FSC as a great value."

            "At Fordham University, “New York is [your] campus” as the school’s Web site says. With campuses throughout New York City, students live and learn in the thick of an urban experience. The school’s original Bronx campus, Rose Hill, is in walking distance to the Bronx Zoo, New York Botanical Gardens and Little Italy. Today, Fordham has two more campuses, the Lincoln Center, which is close to Central Park, and Westchester campus, which is West Harrison, N.Y. Freshmen do not have to live on campus, but any student who is promised housing upon admittance to the school is guaranteed a room for four consecutive years. Students can travel between campuses on the school’s Ram Van, a burgundy shuttle that runs every half hour. The van makes enough trips, the school has calculated, that it’s covered a distance equivalent to traveling around the world 18.5 times a year. The Fordham Rams play in the NCAA Division I Atlantic 10 Conference. Fordham University, a Jesuit institution, does not have a Greek system."

            "More than 200 years ago, Benjamin Franklin donated 200 English pounds to start the school now known as Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa. These days, the institution is a well-regarded liberal arts college home to top-notch research and innovative student programming. One unique component of life as an F&M student is the", 
            "-esque living situation. All first-year students are assigned to one of four college houses, known as Bonchek, Brooks, Schnader, and Ware. Each house is overseen by faculty members called dons and prefects. In each College House, students live together, share meals, and plan and attend events. Freshmen and sophomores must live in their college house, and juniors and seniors can choose to as well. In addition to activities through the college houses, students can choose from about 75 clubs and organizations, including nearly a dozen fraternities and sororities. The Greek system draws more males than females; about 35 percent of men join, compared to about 15 percent of women. The F&M Diplomats sports teams are members of the NCAA Division III Centennial Conference and are especially competitive in men’s basketball and women’s lacrosse. Academic and extracurricular life stops each Thursday from 11:30 a.m. to 12:35 p.m. for Common Hour, a small window of time for students and faculty to attend a campus-wide lecture, movie snippet, or event. The tree-lined campus is in walking distance of downtown Lancaster’s main attractions. Stores and restaurants stay open late for First Friday, a lively celebration at the end of the first week of each month. On Third Fridays, art galleries and performance centers typically host shows. Students can also check out a Barnstormers game at the city’s baseball stadium or shop for groceries and crafts in Central Market, the country’s oldest continually operating farmer’s market. For a more metropolitan experience, Philadelphia is about 1.5 hours away."

            "The mission of Free Will Baptist Bible College (FWBBC) is to educate leaders to serve Christ, His Church, and His world through Biblical thought and life.  The 67-year-old, four-year institution is the only college owned and operated by the National Association of Free Will Baptists, a 250,000-member evangelical denomination with 2,400 churches in 40 states that traces its American origins back to 1727.  While every FWBBC student majors in Bible, many students carry double majors (Bible plus pastoral ministry, Christian education, youth ministry, English, history, teacher education, business, music, psychology, counseling, etc.).  As a Bible college, the institution emphasizes a distinctly Christian education with a strong core of Biblical and theological studies at the heart of all educational programs, a Christian worldview integrating the entire curriculum, Christian morals and ethics, and Christian leadership and service.  The college seeks Christian students who are serious about pursuing academic excellence and doing the will of God.  FWBBC is different from other colleges in that it is a community of faith and learning with chapel four days each week and a commitment to Christian service that places students throughout metropolitan Nashville to serve the homeless and disadvantaged in rescue missions, the congregations in local churches, the elderly in nursing homes, as well as counsel troubled teens, engage in community service projects, and other service roles.  Students volunteer more than 10,000 hours of community service each year through ESL instruction with international students.  Since 1998, the Teacher Education Department at FWBBC has partnered with the Nashville chapter of Junior Achievement to reach students with the importance of education and free enterprise.  FWBBC students have taught more than 265 elementary classes and reached more than 5,000 students.  A Junior Achievement official said that FWBBC was their top non-corporate volunteer provider.  The college is a gathering place for biblical preachers and expositors, for biblical scholars, researchers, and writers.  FWBBC has long believed that education is more than classroom lectures.  What takes place outside the classroom is important in shaping Christian minds, hearts, and hands.  In addition to daily chapel and weekly Christian Service experiences, FWBBC students engage in student government, required artistic events, intramural and intercollegiate athletics, and events such as Missions Conference, Bible Conference, and special lecture series.  The low teacher-student ratio allows FWBBC faculty to interact closely with students and get to know them outside the classroom.  Numerous FWBBC students travel internationally to serve on mission fields during the summer and during fall and spring breaks.  For the first time in 67 years, the college is planning to relocate in the Metropolitan Nashville area and has purchased land in the nearby Gallatin community for a new and larger campus.  The college curriculum is also expanding into the areas of science, biology education, and nursing programs, as well as online learning and adult degree programs.  The college offers 24 baccalaureate and six associate degrees.   Being regionally and nationally accredited college, FWBBC is also a member of the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA). FWBBC is approved by the Tennessee State Department of Education for training veterans, foreign students, and Civil Service employees. The college maintains membership in a number of organizations, including the Tennessee Independent Colleges and Universities Association (TICUA) and the Tennessee College Association.  The college provides a challenging curriculum and a stimulating learning environment.  Professors not only teach their students to think critically as they pursue knowledge in their chosen fields, they also lead them into a deeper understanding of the Bible and the Christian worldview."

            "George Mason University is where innovation is tradition! Mason offers private university quality at a public institution value - at considerably less than what Washington, D.C., area private institutions charge for the same access and degrees. Its prime location just outside Washington, D.C., makes George Mason University's beautiful residential campus the destination for a diverse student body from all over the world, including all 50 states and 131 countries. Mason offers you all of the excitement and options of a large college campus while providing small class sizes and individual attention from faculty and staff members. Our faculty members are well known leaders in their fields, and you will find them quoted daily in national media - and they routinely welcome undergraduates to actively participate in their research. Innovative undergraduate majors and programs in game design, global affairs, neuroscience, sustainability, and international conflict resolution are just a few examples of the way Mason connects expert faculty with the advantages of location to offer you outstanding academic and extracurricular experiences.\r\n\r\nOpportunities to advance your career abound both inside and outside the classroom, including internships at nationally and internationally recognized companies and organizations, ranging from the Smithsonian National Zoo to the White House. Mason alumni dominate the D.C. region, and the resulting work and internship opportunities run the gamut: foreign embassies, wildlife reserves, network news programs, and even the Washington Redskins. Mason students lobby Congress on educational issues, pioneer outreach programs for disadvantaged children, and collect oral histories in the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. The prospect of internships, research, and employment here are unmatched anywhere else. Many Mason graduates continue employment with places they interned, or remain in the area to take advantage of the outstanding job market.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Mason has programs in 28 countries, with reciprocal relationships with a number of foreign universities, including universities in Australia, England, France, Germany, China, and Russia. In partnership with Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and the Higher School of Economics - top Russian universities - Mason has recently launched several dual-degree programs in areas such as economics, management, and international affairs.\r\n\r\nMason guarantees freshman housing, and nearly all freshmen take advantage of the spectacular residence facilities. A growing institution, Mason is in the midst of a building boom, investing more than $1 billion between 2007 and 2013. In 2008, the university opened a new 40,000 square-foot state-of-the-art sustainable dining facility, designed to exceed \"green\" standards, with an emphasis on recycling and the use of biodegradable products. New facilities on campus include performing arts facilities, from a new opera house to dance, percussion and orchestra practice space; state-of-the-art recreation and exercise centers; and a hotel and conference center ideal for visiting students and families. More than 200 clubs and organizations join the large array of on-campus activities, which include free tickets to world-renowned artists at the Center for the Arts, as well as NCAA Basketball and nationally touring rock, hip-hop, rap and country concerts at Mason's 10,000-seat Patriot Center."

While there is no shortage of schools that possess any one of these characteristics, institutions that combine any two of these qualities are less common.  By placing all three side by side at unique levels and combinations, Georgetown provides a special framework that fosters intellectual, social, and spiritual growth."

Student organizations on campus include religious groups, media outlets, and student government associations. The Georgetown Hoyas are part of NCAA’s Division I and are well known for their dominant men’s basketball team, which maintains a fierce rivalry with Syracuse and plays most home games at the Verizon Center, also home to the Washington Wizards. The popular chant \"hoya saxa,\" ancient Greek for \"what rocks,\" gained prominence in 1920 and—contrary to popular belief—has nothing to do with Georgetown’s mascot, Jack the Bulldog."

Foggy Bottom neighborhood, near the State Department and about a mile away from museums on the National Mall and the Washington Monument. GW also has a campus in Mount Vernon, Va. Freshmen do not have to live on campus, though about three fourths choose to do so. The school’s sports teams are nicknamed the Colonials, and compete in the Division I Atlantic 10 Conference. A costumed student called George, named for George Washington, is the school mascot, though an 10-foot inflatable character known as Big George and an on-campus statue of a hippopotamus are unofficial mascots. There are more than 400 organizations on campus, and students can start their own clubs with an original idea and four other members. About 25 percent of students are involved in the school’s large Greek system. The TRAiL program takes students on outdoor excursions like hiking, kayaking, and horseback riding.

            "Thirty years before gunshots would ring across campus, the school now known as Gettysburg College was founded in Pennsylvania. The school is adjacent to the Gettysburg National Military Park, site of a pivotal Civil War matchup between the Union and Confederate armies and where Abraham Lincoln gave his famous Gettysburg Address. Today, the town of Gettysburg is a popular tourist landmark, so students at Gettysburg College have plenty of dining, shopping, and entertainment options to check out. On campus, there are about 120 student clubs and organizations, and  Gettysburg has nearly 20 fraternities and sororities, which more than 40 percent of students join. Freshmen must live on campus, and will be assigned a room near others in the same First-Year Seminar or writing course. Ninety percent of all students opt to live on campus, and sophomores, juniors, and seniors are assigned housing through a lottery system. Living on campus puts students in close proximity to The Attic, the school’s night club. Athletes play on the Gettysburg Bullets in the NCAA Division III Centennial Conference. For a different kind of workout, students can go on hiking, kayaking, and climbing trips run through Gettysburg Recreational Activity Board. GRAB, as it is known for short, also coordinates student- and faculty-led expedition trips around the world, including sea kayaking in Alaska and and hiking the Austrian Alps. GRAB trips are open to Gettysburg students, alumni, parents of students, and faculty members. For closer trips from campus, students can get to Baltimore in an hour, Washington in an hour and a half, and Philadelphia in two hours."

            "Gonzaga University is a private, Roman Catholic institution that is open to students of all faiths. Residing along the Spokane River, it is less than half a mile to downtown Spokane, Wash. On campus, there are more than 95 active clubs for students to choose from. Intramural sports are very popular at Gonzaga, with more than 60 percent of the student body participating. The Bulldogs of Gonzaga are part of the NCAA Division I West Coast Conference. The men’s basketball team is the pride and joy of the university, and the team has returned the love by winning more than 90 percent of its games at the school’s McCarthey Athletic Center. At Gonzaga, students are required to live on campus during their first two years, but the university has stated that on-campus housing is not guaranteed for an entire college career. Students interested in outdoor pursuits can journey to the 100-acre Riverfront Park and go ice skating in the winter or check out the sky ride over the falls. They can also explore the Spokane River Centennial Trail, a 37-mile paved trail perfect for walking, running, skating, or biking."

            "Goucher College is a small college with a big view of the world, an intellectual community without boundaries.  Here, students are prepared to embark on a life of inquiry and discovery, creativity, and analytical thinking; the expectation is that Goucher graduates will go on to make a positive difference in the world.  At Goucher College, we are known for our academic rigor, our never-ending curiosity about the world around us; and the high caliber of our faculty, students, and staff.  Goucher students are able to put their learning into action through collaborative research in the natural sciences, guest residencies of renowned professors, service-learning programs that support local communities, unique internships, and international study.  Building on these strengths, our vision for a liberal arts education grows from the understanding that in the 21st century, every academic inquiry and intellectual endeavor has a global context.  In all of our 31 majors, we encourage our students to explore their intellectual interests in ways that transcend the boundaries of traditional disciplines.  Goucher's well-known study-abroad requirement, which comes with a great deal of curricular flexibility and a $1,200 stipend to help defray travel costs, is just one of the college's distinctive assets.  Another is its Athenaeum: Part high-tech library, part public forum, part art gallery, part cafe, and many other parts, this new flagship building at the center of campus is \"all Goucher.\"  The Athenaeum assumes an integrated, harmonious place within a pedestrian-friendly, architecturally unified campus.  The numerous, world-class lecturers who visit this beautiful campus every year give our students the opportunity to step up and ask important questions of important people.  The college's environmental initiatives, both curricular and extracurricular, have derived much of their direction and momentum from the suggestions and activities of our students.  And Goucher's greatest strength may well be its abiding sense of community, at once expansive and inclusive.  For 125 years, Goucher has served a bright, bold, and motivated student population. Numbering some 1,480 undergraduates and representing 45 states and 24 countries, our students arrive at Goucher prepared to excel academically and eager to take advantage of the many resources offered on campus and in nearby Baltimore and Washington, DC.  Our 287-acre, beautifully landscaped campus boasts comfortable residence halls, a modern athletic complex and playing fields, stables, and miles of wooded trails to fulfill our student explorers."

            "Located just outside of the Grand Rapids area, Michigan’s second-largest metropolitan region, is Grand Valley State University. Although it is one of America’s 100 largest universities in terms of enrollment, Grand Valley strives to make a liberal education its foundation for all of its academic programs. Freshmen are exposed to more than 300 student organizations during an event called “Campus Life Night,” which allows students to explore the many options for extracurricular activities. About 5 percent of the undergraduate community participates in Greek life, and there are more than 20 chapters to choose from. While it is not required, the university recommends that all first year students live on campus to more easily become involved in campus life. The Grand Valley State Lakers are members of the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in the NCAA Division II. The athletic prowess of the university is unheralded, and the school has won the Director’s Cup seven times in its history as the best NCAA Division II athletic program in the nation."

Despite its somewhat remote location, this \"Little School on the Prairie\" has a lot to offer. From the G-Tones a cappella group for music lovers to the environmental group Free the Plant for tree huggers, Grinnell’s 100-plus student organizations appeal to a variety of interests. Grinnell’s busy social scene makes up for its lack of Greek life with an array of cultural activities and concerts occurring weekly on campus, from big-name acts to small student groups. A well-known, annual event is the Titular Head Film Festival, which showcases student films. The Grinnell Pioneers compete in the NCAA Division III Midwest Conference. In fact, the Pioneers played some of the first intercollegiate football and baseball games west of the Mississippi. All students are required to live on campus in residence halls located on South, North, or East campuses."

            "Since its founding in 1876, Grove City College, committed to Christian principles, has striven to be equal in academic quality to the finest four-year colleges.  It seeks to provide liberal and professional education of the highest quality that is within the reach of families with modest means who desire a college that will strengthen their children's spiritual and moral character.  The founders of Grove City College, consciously avoiding narrow sectarianism, held a vision of Christian society transcending denomination, creeds, and confessions.  They were committed to the advancement of free enterprise, civil and religious liberty, representative government, arts and letters, and science and technology.  Believing that the fruits of civilization would be destroyed if religious and ethical roots were allowed to wither, the founders intended that the claims of Christ as God and Savior and of inspired Scripture be presented to all.  They hoped that through its program of intellectual, moral, and spiritual education, Grove City College would produce young leaders, whatever their creed or confession, capable of pushing civilization forward on every frontier."

            "Gustavus Adolphus College is a residential, liberal arts college in St. Peter, Minnesota, that prepares 2,550 undergraduate students for lives of leadership, service, and lifelong learning. The oldest Lutheran college in Minnesota, Gustavus was founded in 1862 by Swedish Lutheran immigrants and named for Swedish King Gustav II Adolf. Gustavus Adolphus College is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). Throughout its history, it has valued its Lutheran and Swedish heritages.\r\n\r\nThe Gustavus culture derives from our founding traditions and offers a distinctiveness of feeling and deed on the campus and in the greater world. Students and faculty pursue academic rigor and service in an atmosphere of close-knit relationships, serious work, spirited enjoyment of life, and uncommon mutual support.\r\n\r\nAt Gustavus, students receive personal attention in small-sized classes and engage in collaborative research with their professors. The College is fully accredited and known for its strong music, science, writing, athletics, study-abroad, and service-learning programs. We maintain a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa and are widely admired for our annual MAYDAY! Peace Conference-an event devoted to topics relating to human rights and social justice.\r\n\r\nGustavus is internationally recognized for its annual Nobel Conference. This signature event was launched in 1965 following a gathering on campus of 26 Nobel laureates for the dedication of the Nobel Hall of Science in 1963. The conference brings cutting-edge science issues to the attention of the public, engages world-renowned science speakers, and provides opportunities to explore the moral and societal impact of scientific issues. \r\n\r\nGustavus has always prized community and has been marked by a pervasive sense of concern for every member of the College community. Civility, mutual respect, cooperation, shared governance, and caring have long been hallmarks of the College. Freedom to express a broad range of ideas is central to our sense of community, and resolution of conflicts in the broader society has long been a fundamental concern for us.\r\n\r\nGustavus has a commitment to high quality, even to excellence, in all that we do. In the words of Eric Norelius, founder of the College, \"Whatever we do, let us do it well.\" Given our other values, it should be clear that this commitment to excellence is neither a code word for elitism nor a rejection of the best in Gustavus's heritage. Indeed, our distinctive heritage demands nothing less than excellence.\r\n\r\nGustavus holds the conviction that religious faith enriches and informs learning and is a fundamental notion underpinning our emphasis on community, ethics, and service.  While strongly Lutheran in tradition and character, conformity to that specific faith tradition is not expected.  In it mission statement, the College does declare an intent to develop in students \"a mature understanding of the Christian faith\".  People of all faiths are welcomed and engaged here.\r\n\r\nThe Swedish and religious heritage of Gustavus, specifically its Lutheran roots and bonds, have ensured that justice and fairness are primary institutional values. The College strives to be a just community in all of its actions and to educate its students for morally responsible lives. Relations within the College community are guided by high moral principles, and those graduating from Gustavus are expected to understand the full moral implications of their actions.\r\n\r\nThe College values service as an objective of life and of education. We embrace the notion that true leadership expresses itself in service to others, and affirm the classical ideal of a liberating education, an education that frees one to serve God and humanity to the best of one's ability."

            "The spirit of Hampden-Sydney lies in its sense of community and its preservation of tradition. HSC is all about seeking \"to form good men and good citizens in an atmosphere of sound learning\". Honor and civility inform the life of the College.  Challenged by the curriculum and guided by the professors, students can get help when they need it because classes are small. The greatest advantage of small-college life is that everyone can be involved.  Athletics, debating, publications, fraternity life -- all are part of the education process. Many students enjoy the outdoors: hunting, fishing, camping, and hiking. Public service, leadership, and volunteerism are developed through opportunities to participate in the HSC Volunteer Fire Department, The Wilson Center for Leadership, community service projects with the local community, and \"Beyond the Hill\" community service trips to Belize, Honduras, and other service oriented trips abroad.  \r\n     In addition to the College's own study abroad programs, HSC students are eligible to participate and earn academic credit in approved foreign-study programs in Europe, Central and South America, South and East Asia, the Middle East, and the Virginia program at Oxford. In addition, the HSC faculty develop May Term Abroad programs in special topics in their discipline. Past programs have included European Union Studies in France, Economics/Political Science/Culture studies in Eastern Europe, Tropical Biology in Mexico, Theater in Scotland, Language Immersion in Spain, and Area Studies in Egypt.\r\n     The total experience at the College produces a man well-suited for the challenges of a job, the demands of social service, and the pleasure of personal endeavors."

            "Hanover College is a challenging and supportive community whose members take responsibility for lifelong inquiry, transformative learning and meaningful service.  Hanover College students prepare for the future by embracing the present.  Hanover's students receive personal attention from professors in a highly caring environment.  The College's 10 to 1 student-faculty ratio and average class size of 12 students leads to interactive classes where students develop the skills necessary for critical thinking and problem-solving, skills that are essential in today's rapidly changing world.\r\n\r\nIndividualized attention allows students to become actively engaged in experiential learning.  Experiential learning is supported through the availability of a tuition-free academic internship for any interested student.  Project-based internships through the College's business program, the Center for Business Preparation, enable Hanover's students to apply their critical thinking and problem-solving skills and develop a record of actual accomplishment before they graduate.  Additional internships through the Career Center, including semester-long programs in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., provide opportunities for every student to explore careers and develop resumes during their four years at Hanover.  In addition, nearly two-thirds of Hanover's students take advantage of conducting research in partnership with a faculty mentor.  Student research provides important experience that prepares them for medical school, graduate school and business careers.  The result is outstanding placement of seniors in career opportunities or graduate school.\r\n\r\nHanover students are engaged nationally and internationally.  The Hanover Capstone on great issues of the day provides one such opportunity.  Our 2009-2010 Capstone, entitled Forging an American Identiy, included talks by Ric Burns (documentarian), and Jeff Shaara (best-selling novelist), among others. The 2008-2009 Capstone entitled Water: The Rise and Fall of Civilization led to on-campus lectures by Zahi Hawass (Secretary General of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities), Mia Farrow (activist and actress), Bill Nye (The Science Guy), and Robert Kennedy, Jr. (activist).  The 2007-2008 Capstone Global Climate Change included on-campus lectures by Jane Goodall, Jean-Michel Cousteau, Richard Leakey and Ed Begley, Jr.  The culmination of each year's Capstone is the publication of an anthology of the best student papers on that year's subject.\r\n\r\nExperience is also gained through the College's extensive study abroad program.  From four-week spring term courses that travel to countries such as England, Ireland, South Africa, China, and Vietnam, to semester-long affiliated programs in Australia, Turkey, Belgium, Germany, France, Spain and Mexico, to summer research and internships in India, Thailand, Turkey and France, roughly 55% of Hanover students have traveled throughout the world.  Most of these students received financial support from the College to assist them in taking advantage of this opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe Hanover experience extends beyond the classroom.  Roughly one-third of Hanover's students participate in NCAA athletics.  Students do not have to major in theatre and music to participate and be eligible for scholarships in those outstanding programs.  Every one of the College's 56 student clubs and organizations, ranging from the campus newspaper to ultimate Frisbee, are established and run by students.  The next new student club is the one you want to organize.\r\n\r\nAll of this occurs on a beautiful campus located on bluffs overlooking the Ohio River.  Located in southeastern Indiana, Hanover possesses rural charm while located in the middle of a triangle that includes the major cities of Louisville (45 minutes away), Cincinnati (75 minutes) and Indianapolis (90 minutes)."

            "As a small, private liberal arts college, Hartwick College focuses on fostering collaborative student-faculty relationships: our faculty bring the latest insights from the world into the classroom to deepen student learning.  The college's beautiful setting upon a hill overlooking Oneonta, New York features the close relationships expected from a small private liberal arts college of 1480 students with a student-to-faculty ratio of 11:1.  Our philosophy puts an emphasis on experiential learning so that students are prepared to continuously shape and reshape their future.  When our students study abroad, complete an internship, collaborate with a professor on a research project, or work in the local community, their learning translates into an education that changes lives. More than 60 percent of Hartwick students gain first-hand experience either studying off-campus or completing an internship. Hartwick's faculty lead off-campus programs all over the world during our January Term, which allows students to broaden their horizons. \r\n\r\nOur unique academic calendar, centered on the four week January Term, not only enables students to travel the world, but also offers opportunities to undertake a topic-focused class, do an internship, perform directed research, or complete a senior capstone project.  Our nearby Pine Lake Environmental Campus has also provided residential and curricular opportunities for students to investigate the importance of sustainability since 1972.  In contrast to the recent scramble among institutions to configure opportunities for experiential learning, Hartwick has been offering these core educational components to students for more than three decades.  The entire Hartwick community, from academic to residential life and athletics, now embraces this longstanding commitment to experiential learning through our approach to a liberal arts education. \r\n\r\nHartwick is excited to offer a Three-Year Bachelor's Degree. A unique and exciting opportunity allowing qualified students to benefit from our strong liberal arts education and special experiential learning opportunities. This program dramatically reduces the cost of a private college education. Students in the program can take advantage of every opportunity offered in our traditional four-year program."

            "Hastings College is a private, undergraduate, four-year, residential liberal arts college. It was founded in 1882 by a group of men and women seeking to establish a Presbyterian-related college dedicated to high academic and cultural standards that still apply over 125 years later.  Our home is Hastings, Nebraska, a friendly, progressive, fun college town of 25,000.  The Hastings College campus is situated on 109 beautifully landscaped acres. Within that space sits 40 buildings spanning from the traditional McCormick Hall built in 1883 to the Osborne Family Sports Complex / Fleharty Educational Center built in 2002 and the comfortable Bronco Village student apartments completed in 2006. An outdoor track complex was completed in 2007 and The Morrison-Reeves Science Center, a brand new state of the art student learning facility, opened for classes in 2009.  Hastings College is named one of America's Best Value Colleges by The Princeton Review, ranked among the top liberal arts colleges in the nation by U.S. News & World Report, America's Best Colleges 2009, named a 2010 \"Best College in the Midwestern Region\" by The Princeton Review , listed by Kaplan/Newsweek as one of \"America's 369 Most Interesting Schools,\" and recognized among the top liberal arts colleges in America by The Washington Monthly.Affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA), the college enrolls students representing many denominational groups.One of the most successful and popular features of Hastings College's academic program, January Term, allows students to immerse themselves in one course, instead of four or five. Students can focus on a topic in their major field or study something new. J-Term at HC is a time for discovery, innovation and unforgettable learning experiences.  In past years, student groups have traveled to Tanzania to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro, Australia, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Central America, Italy and Ireland. On campus classes have included a study of the Beatles, the psychology of superheroes, and comic and graphic novel story telling and illustration.In the Noel-Levitz Student Satisfaction Inventory, a national survey that measures student satisfaction across a broad spectrum of college life, Hastings College students expressed greater satisfaction than did students from the national comparison group on items such as: the instruction in my major field is excellent, tuition paid is a worthwhile investment, and it is an enjoyable experience to be a student on this campus. Over the past four years, Hastings College students completed nearly 50,000 hours of service-learning on the hurricane-ravaged Gulf Coast, in Appalachia, on U.S.-Mexico borderlands, and locally in homeless shelters, churches and schools.  Hastings College has been named to the President???s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll with Distinction for its exemplary community service, innovative service-learning programs and demonstrated commitment to strengthening the community.  Hastings College is known nationally for its success in fostering a campus environment where people work together in a spirit of collegiality, collaboration, openness and mutual respect. The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) presented Hastings College President Phillip Dudley, Jr. with the Ralph S. Brown Award for Shared Governance at a ceremony in Washington, D.C."

            "As a leader in engaged liberal arts and sciences education, Hendrix provides a demanding yet supportive environment where tomorrow???s leaders learn to combine critical thought with action.  A private, undergraduate institution of the liberal arts founded in 1876 and related to the United Methodist Church, Hendrix offers distinguished academic programs in a residential setting. A 13-to-1 student-faculty ratio encourages student engagement and interaction with faculty. Students and faculty come together in a learning community, with the shared goal of helping each student develop ???Unto the Whole Person,??? which is the College???s motto. Hendrix College students are actively engaged in their education, involved in learning in a hands-on way that takes them outside the book and into the world. A new component of the curriculum ??? Your Hendrix Odyssey: Engaging in Active Learning ??? is the reason for an increase in engagement and an explosion of energy and enthusiasm on the Hendrix campus. The Odyssey Program, launched in fall 2005, requires that students complete at least three experiential learning projects during their college careers. Students chose from six categories:  artistic creativity, service to the world, global awareness, professional and leadership development, undergraduate research, and special projects. Students receive transcript recognition for completing Odyssey projects. Competitive grants are available to help fund the cost of Odyssey projects, ensuring that all students can participate regardless of their financial situation. Since the program began, Hendrix students and faculty members have shared more than $1.3 million in grants to fund projects ranging from teaching English in rural China and delivering medical supplies to poor Mexican villages to planting and learning from a vegetable garden on campus.  Incoming students are eligible for Odyssey Distinction Awards, scholarships of $1,000 to $6,000, based on their experiential activities in high school. The Odyssey program has developed from Hendrix???s long-standing commitment to experiential learning, which includes an emphasis on undergraduates conducting research in various fields and presenting their results in national forums such as at annual meetings of the American Chemical Society and the National Council for Undergraduate Research. Innovations in the curriculum are matched by a renewal in campus facilities. The College has recently replaced all its science facilities, constructed new residence halls and student apartments, and built a new home for a special program in language and literature. In January 2010, the College opened a new Student Life and Technology Center, a building blending traditional campus center spaces with cutting-edge technology in an Educational Technology Center.  In addition to the resources available in the ETC, technology clusters located throughout the building allow students to work or play in small groups and a video conferencing center lets Hendrix students collaborate with students and faculty at other institutions across the country or around the world. A new Wellness and Athletics Center opened in 2007, featuring space for intercollegiate sports, wellness and fitness activities, intramurals, and kinesiology classrooms and labs. Hendrix, a NCAA Division III (non-scholarship) school that competes in the Southern Collegiate Athletics Conference, fields 19 intercollegiate sports teams. The College is developing The Village at Hendrix, an area east of the campus, into a retail and residential neighborhood expected to include businesses that will provide varied amenities for students within an easy walk of the campus. Hendrix students became the first residents of The Village in Fall 2009 when 130 upperclassmen moved into College-owned apartments over the first commercial spaces in the neighborhood. More information about the College is available at www.hendrix.edu."

            "Hiram College offers distinctive programs that set us apart from other small, private liberal arts colleges. About half of Hiram's students study abroad at some point during their four years. In 2008-2009, a group of 19 students led by two faculty members traveled around the world to study climate change, stopping in nine different locations. Common study abroad destinations include France, China, Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, the Galapagos Islands, and several African countries. Because Hiram students receive credits for the courses taught by Hiram faculty on these trips, studying abroad will not impede progress in their majors or delay graduation. Another unique aspect of a Hiram education is our academic calendar, known as the Hiram Plan. Our semesters are divided into 12-week and 3-week periods. Students usually enroll in three courses during each 12-week, and one intensive course during the 3-week. Many students spend the 3-week on study abroad trips or taking unusual courses not typically offered during the 12-week. Our small classes encourage interaction between students and their professors. Students can work with professors on original research projects and often participate in musical groups and intramural sports teams alongside faculty members. Finally, the Hiram College Tuition Guarantee ensures that the annual cost for tuition will not increase between the first year a student is enrolled and the student's senior year."

            "Hofstra University is a dynamic, private university where students succeed and study in about 140 undergraduate and 150 graduate programs of study. The major divisions of the university provide students with a broad array of academic offerings: the Hofstra College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the School of Communication, the Frank G. Zarb School of Business, the School of Education, Health and Human Services, the School of Law, and Honors College.  In 2010, the University is planning a year-long celebration in recognition of Hofstra's 75 anniversary.\r\n\r\nA student-faculty ratio of 14-to-1 and an average class size of 22 allow professors to teach small classes that emphasize interaction, critical thinking and analysis.\r\n\r\nHofstra's students are motivated and success-oriented, and Hofstra provides the resources they need to reach their goals: an outstanding faculty, extensive academic resources and state-of-the-art facilities. Internships that take advantage of the proximity of New York City and special educational programs are designed to develop individual students' interests and abilities.\r\nHofstra's faculty is one of its greatest resources. Ninety-one percent of full-time faculty members hold the highest degree in their fields. Faculty members are dedicated to excellence in teaching, scholarship and research, and many have been recognized with the nation' highest honors, including membership in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Fulbright and Guggenheim Fellowships, National Science Foundation and National Endowment for the Humanities awards, and Emmy Awards.\r\n\r\nHofstra's distinctive, 240-acre campus, a recognized arboretum, is located 25 miles from New York City. The campus features state-of-the art teaching facilities, including a converged newsroom and multimedia classroom, one of the most advanced academic trading rooms in the nation, six theaters and a rooftop observatory.

            "In keeping with the university's commitment to small classes and personalized instruction, science students conduct original research with faculty members in their areas.  The results of these research projects are routinely submitted to competitive scholastic organizations like the Texas Academy of Science.  Howard Payne students routinely achieve recognition in these forums.  \r\nThe university is committed to providing learning outside the classroom.  Students across the academic disciplines engage in competitions for creative awards.  Participation in Model Senate, Model U.N., Student Speakers Bureau, forensic competition, and intercollegiate student government organizations are examples.\r\nThe Douglas MacArthur Academy of Freedom, our widely-acclaimed honors program, produces innovative leaders in law, politics, business, ministry, government, medicine, education, psychology and social work.  Students in our pre-law program prepare for law school by participating in Moot Court where they have won numerous awards while competing against some of the largest universities in Texas.  \r\nThe School of Christian Studies sponsors a Youth Ministry Workshop led by veteran youth ministers from across the country.  Our students receive valuable insight and make contacts with professional mentors and role models who are serving in the field.\r\nThe university theatre program engages students from all academic disciplines.  Because Brownwood is a regional cultural center, these performances are community-wide events.\r\nMusic students perform junior- and senior-level recitals that draw audiences from across the campus and the community.  Art students' creative works also are shared campus-wide and made available for public viewing.  \r\nProfessional education in business, teacher education, and social work prepare highly marketable graduates."

            "Humboldt State University offers students personal attention from their professors in a small, residential community. There are plenty of academic choices, with 47 majors and nationally recognized programs in natural resources and science. Hands-on experiences often supplement classroom instruction, and students take part in hundreds of volunteer projects and internships in the surrounding area. \r\nWith an enrollment of 7,800, Humboldt State is large enough to offer a lively campus and major research facilities, but small enough that students are not lost in a crowd. It???s a tight-knit community where professors and staff are known for really getting to know students.\r\nHumboldt State is about five hours north of San Francisco and 90 minutes south of Oregon on California???s redwood coast. Six rivers, mountains, forests and beaches provide an ideal environment for learning and living. Students picnic at the same beaches where they study marine life, and outdoor activities are practically limitless. Humboldt State???s hometown of Arcata, as well as nearby Eureka, feature plenty of coffee houses, restaurants and shopping. In a single day, a student could surf or snowboard, study for a couple of hours and then attend a concert. In fact, Arcata was named by Outside magazine as one of its top 15 college towns and National Geographic recently named it one of its ???50 next great adventure towns.???\r\nHumboldt State students started the Graduation Pledge of Social and Environmental Responsibility, which has been adopted by hundreds of universities worldwide. That commitment is reflected in many of the University???s class offerings, research efforts and projects. These include the Humboldt Energy Independence Fund, which funds student-led campus energy-saving projects, and the student-run sustainability demonstration house known as the Campus Center for Appropriate Technology, which is one of the oldest of its kind. In addition, students annually give more than 35,000 hours of volunteer work through service learning classes, and Humboldt State is consistently among the leading institutions in providing Peace Corps volunteers. For this and more, the Princeton Review includes Humboldt State on its list of 81 Colleges with a Conscience, as well as among its Best Western Colleges. \r\nThe campus offers more than 180 academic, career, cultural, sports and lifestyle clubs. Art exhibits and lectures take place throughout the year, and the University???s Center Arts brings in nationally recognized performers and speakers. The campus has a student recreational facility with a state-of-the-art fitness/wellness center, and a recently completed physical education facility features kinesiology labs and gym space. Twelve intercollegiate athletic teams compete at the Division II level, including football, a nationally ranked softball squad and a highly competitive men???s basketball team."

            "Founded in 1890, Illinois Institute of Technology is a private, Ph.D.-granting university with more than 7,500 students in engineering, sciences, architecture, psychology, design, humanities, business, and law. IIT's interprofessional, technology-focused curriculum is designed to advance knowledge through research and scholarship and to cultivate invention improving the human condition.  IIT students have the resources of a major urban center along with the intimacy of a 120-acre green campus.  IIT's Main Campus is located just three miles from the downtown business district of Chicago and across the street from U.S. Cellular Field, home of the Chicago White Sox. The American Institute of Architects named the IIT Main Campus one of the 200 most significant works of architecture in the United States, with 14 buildings designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and two new buildings by architects Helmut Jahn and Rem Koolhaas. IIT recognizes the importance of moving our world toward a more sustainable path and has created the Office of Campus Energy and Sustainability whose mission is to make IIT the most sustainable urban university campus in the United States. As part of the initiative, IIT has launched a Perfect Power System that consists of \"smart\" microgrids. It will offer IIT the opportunity to eliminate costly outages, minimize power disturbances, moderate an ever-growing demand, and curb greenhouse gas emissions. Students experience IIT's interprofessional approach to learning through the Interprofessional Projects Program (IPRO). Each semester-long IPRO project course is a team-based learning environment in which students from various concentrations and disciplines work together to study a real-world problem. Student IPRO projects have included such challenges as clean drinking water for the world's rural poor and an artificial pancreas. Every student is required to participate in two projects during their undergraduate study. Every admitted student is automatically considered for the Heald and University Scholarships, up to $10,000 each annually. The top 1% of IIT applicants are invited to apply and interview for the Camras Scholars Program, a full-tuition scholarship benefit that brings our best students together with our best opportunities. IIT is a member of the NAIA conference, with competitive men's and women's teams in baseball, volleyball, swimming, cross country, and soccer.  IIT also offers a variety of intramural sports and more than 100 diverse organizations, including several through the office of Multicultural Student Services. IIT is home to many research centers including the Pritzker Institute of Biomedical Science and Engineering and the newly formed Wanger Institute for Sustainable Energy Research. Undergraduate students have the opportunity to participate in research at IIT. Government; foundation; and industry-funded research projects are happening in all areas of science, engineering, technology, and mathematics. These research experiences offer students the opportunity to be involved in cutting-edge research, applying their knowledge and skills outside the classroom. Research opportunities are promoted through the office of Undergraduate research. IIT provides students with a distinctive and relevant education in an environment of scientific, technological, and professional knowledge creation and innovation."

            "Situated on 80 tree-filled acres in the city of Bloomington, Ill., Illinois Wesleyan University is home to just over 2,000 college students from across the world. Located less than two hours from both Chicago and St. Louis, students have the opportunity to experience a rural and urban lifestyle of their choosing. There are more than 160 student organizations on campus for students to choose from, along with a very popular Greek life. More than one third of the student body participates in roughly 10 fraternities and sororities available at Illinois Wesleyan. While freshmen are required to live on campus, 8 in 10 students choose this living arrangement during their entire college career. Known as the Titans, Illinois Wesleyan is a member of the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin in the NCAA’s Division III. Although known for its successful baseball and track teams, the school also ranks in the Top 10 universities nationally with more than 100 Academic All-Americans. One of the most popular features of the university is its May term, known as “Play Term” by students, which is a monthlong experimental learning option where students focus on a single course or topic."

            "No one quite knows what a “Hoosier” is, but a murky definition does not stop students at Indiana University— Bloomington from fiercely identifying with the term. The school’s sports teams are notorious competitors in the NCAA Division I Big Ten Conference, and, since Indiana University does not have a mascot, all teams are known simply as Hoosiers. There are more than 650 student organizations on campus, and more than 5,000 students go Greek in the school’s large community of fraternities and sororities. Freshmen must live on campus unless they live at home with their parents, are over the age of 21, are married, or are pledging a fraternity or sorority. The Indiana campus is tobacco free, though students may smoke in their own vehicles. The Midwestern college town of Bloomington, or B-town, as it is known to many, is home to a lively cultural scene. Arts and entertainment performances, such as the annual Lotus World Music & Arts Festival, take place year round. Students can explore the surrounding area through the Indiana University Outdoor Adventures program, which coordinates boating, caving, and rock and gorge climbing trips. Active students can compete in the annual Little 500, the largest collegiate bike race in the nation and a fundraiser for university scholarships, or spend 36 hours on their feet in the IU Dance Marathon, a fundraiser for Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis."

            "Hawkeyes. Despite the Cyclones moniker, the school mascot is a cardinal named Cy because a cyclone was hard to put into costume form. There are nearly 50 fraternities and sororities at Iowa State, and most chapters have their own houses. Freshmen do not have to live on campus, and Greek members can move into sorority or fraternity houses during their first year at school. The Greek system is sizable, but, at a school as large as Iowa State, it counts less than 10 percent of students among its members. There are more than 100 undergraduate majors offered at Iowa State, and, through the Soar in 4 initiative, advisers work with students to ensure they graduate in four years. For a study break, students can take a stroll through the roses in Reiman Gardens or check out more than 600 works of art around the campus—the biggest collection at any school in the country. Each spring, students put on VEISHEA, a campus-wide celebration with a parade and famous musical performers. For trips off campus, Des Moines is 30 minutes away."

            "John Carroll is a private, coeducational, Catholic and Jesuit university providing programs in the liberal arts, sciences and business at the undergraduate level and in selected areas at the master's level. As a Jesuit Catholic university, John Carroll inspires individuals to excel in learning, leadership, and service in the region and in the world. Academically, we stress that each individual is important and students must be given focused, caring, personal attention. Students are challenged to pursue wisdom, competence, psychological maturity, spiritual strength, ethical grounding and social and\r\nglobal awareness. The hallmark of this person-centered reality of Jesuit, liberal arts education is that it must always lead to action. Students are encouraged to use their knowledge and abilities in service to the world; to make a difference for others. The Boler School of Business consistently ranks in the top 10 business schools in the Midwest and is AACSB International (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business) accredited -- a prestigious distinction that is only awarded to the top 10-12% of business schools nationally. In the 2009-2010 academic year, John Carroll has developed a number new academic programs including: Entrepreneurship, Leadership, East Asian Studies, Peace, Justice and Human Rights; all tied to the existing academic planning process.  Outside of the classroom, over 2,000 members of the JCU community, including students, faculty, and staff, participated in over 30,000 hours of some form of community-based service on behalf of the University during the academic year. In February 2010, John Carroll was one of 23 Jesuit institutions nationally recognized for involvement in community service by The President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll.  More than 150 students participated in immersion experiences traveling to Nicaragua, Honduras, Jamaica, Ecuador, Appalachia, Chicago, Biloxi, New Orleans, Louisville, and Cleveland. They have served meals, helped build homes and spent time with families discussing faith, values and mission. Fourteen immersion trips helped students learn about the challenges faced by people living in other parts of the country, the world, and in their own backyard. The Saint John's Bible -- the first handwritten and hand-illuminated Bible in 500 years -- debuted at John Carroll in April 2008 for permanent display in the Grasselli Library and Breen Learning Center.  Our graduates are in demand with 99% of our graduates from 2009 employed full-time or in full-time graduate programs within nine months of graduation. Our distinguished faculty includes 212 full-time members; 94% hold doctoral degrees or the terminal degree in their field; 78% are tenured; 13% are on a tenure track; 11% are visiting professors; 9 are Fulbright Fellows; 190 have published books, articles or have received research grants in the past two years. Our student/teacher ratio is 15:1."

            "Judson University is an evangelical Christian university providing an excellent liberal arts education and equipping students to be fully developed, responsible persons who glorify God by the quality of their personal relationships, work and citizenship within their community and the world. Located just 40 miles from Chicago and situated on 90-acres along the banks of the Fox River, Judson offers more than 60 majors, minors and concentrations, plus 10 pre-professional programs and graduate programs in the areas of business, communications, science, math, music, art and design, architecture, interior design, youth ministry, media art, psychology, education, worship arts and more. Through a broadly based education in liberal arts, sciences and professions, Judson University enables its students to acquire ideas and concepts, which sharpen their insights, develop skills appropriate to their career goals and develop the skills and commitment for life-long learning. A Judson education involves challenging academics with small class sizes taught by fully qualified faculty; practical application of professional skills through internships and real-world projects; an investment in spiritual development through small groups, weekly participation in chapel, mission and service projects; and quality peer interactions through many campus clubs, intramurals and Judson's conference-winning athletic teams. The university's commitment and leadership to ecological conservation led it to build one of the most energy efficient and environmentally friendly buildings in North America, which houses Judson's fully accredited Architecture, Art and Design Program and its library. Judson's graduates bear witness to the university's achievements of integrating faith and learning to become leaders who passionately live out the call to be Christ's light in the world."

            "A historically black college founded in 1886 to train African American teachers, Kentucky State University never strayed from its roots of providing the most eager students access to a higher education. KSU continually finds ways to help students fulfill their dreams of earning a degree: whether securing them financial aid to begin and continue their educational journey; preparing students for college-level study with refresher courses and pre-entry programs; providing a flexible class schedule to allow working students to take classes online, at lunch or after work; or offering small class sizes and accessible teachers, which gives teachers and students more individualized time for instruction.\r\n\r\nThe faculty, staff and students embody the most diverse mix in the Commonwealth. More than 40 percent of the campus represent various ethnicities besides African American, including students from Central America, the Caribbean, Asian countries and Europe. Several years ago, KSU launched a Hispanic Initiative to better serve the needs of the Latino populations in Kentucky and to encourage more Hispanics to attend college. Since then, more Hispanics have turned to KSU. KSU also reached across the ocean to establish research partnerships and exchange programs with colleges and universities in China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan. Now, several KSU students teach English as a second language overseas or study in Asia while their counterparts stay in Frankfort and learn to be English as a second language teachers for their home countries.\r\n\r\nKSU provides something for everyone from traditional liberal arts fare to business, science, agricultural studies, fine arts, nursing, education, criminal justice, social work and aquaculture. In the last three years, the graduate studies program has grown. KSU now offers master's degrees in aquaculture, business administration, environmental studies, computer science, public administration and the online master's in special education. The university continues to expand its course selection by introducing the new journalism/mass communications degree program and specializations for the master's in business administration. \r\n\r\nThe only 1890 Land Grant institution in Kentucky, KSU focuses on agricultural studies, extension services, competitive research and its program of distinction, aquaculture. KSU's Community Research Service and Aquaculture faculty are breaking ground with their experiments and helping bolster the state's and nation's economy. \r\n\r\nFor example, aquaculture researchers are teaching Kentucky farmers how to cultivate a caviar, shrimp and tilapia crop. The aquaculture department also partnered with the Frankfort Sewer Department to explore a new, safer, more effective way to harvest paddlefish while simultaneously cleaning wastewater. Aquaculture has become the fastest growing segment of agriculture in America and a booming business throughout the world. KSU leads the state in offering aquaculture as a viable cash crop alternative for former tobacco farmers. \r\n\r\nThe Land Grant program staff also educates part-time and small farmers about how to make their land more profitable and how to sustain natural and financial obstacles through a series of outreach initiatives and workshops on campus. Meanwhile, KSU students partner with Land Grant Community Research Service researchers to test theories, conduct experiments and aid in national and international research, which gives them experience for graduate school and their future careers and also allows them to publish and present their findings at local, state and national competitions. \r\n\r\nIn the past five years, the message about KSU has spread. Applications and admissions have increased substantially, making KSU the fastest growing university in Kentucky since 2006. This not only benefits the niversity and students, it helps Kentucky reach its goal of having 400,000 bachelor's degree recipients living in-state."

            "In Gambier, Ohio, it’s hard to tell where the Kenyon College campus stops and the small downtown begins. The hilly campus of the liberal arts college runs into the town’s quaint shops, and the main walkway of campus, Middle Path, intersects downtown. On campus, there are more than 150 student clubs and organizations, including about a dozen fraternities and sororities. The Kenyon student body has slightly more females than males, and freshmen must live in a common residential area. Students are allowed to bring televisions to their dorm rooms, but freshmen rooms do not have cable, and most upperclass students’ rooms don’t, either. A third of students play on the varsity Lords and Ladies sports teams, which compete in the NCAA Division III North Coast Athletic Conference. The school offers more than 150 study abroad opportunities, including the Kenyon-Honduras Archaeology and Anthropology Program and the Kenyon in Rome program. For a different experience closer to home, Columbus—the state capital and home of Ohio State University—is a 45-mile drive away. Each year, students celebrate the impending spring season with a semi-formal dance, known as the Philander’s Phebruary Phling. Students begin and end their time at Kenyon in song, as the First-Year Sing and Senior Sing are two of the biggest traditions on campus."

            "Nestled in the College Hill neighborhood of Easton, Pa., is Lafayette College, a liberal arts institution. Easton is a quiet, rural town about 60 miles from Philadelphia and 70 from New York City. One perk of living in rural Pennsylvania: in warm months, students can load up on fresh produce each Saturday at the Easton Farmer’s Market, billed as the nation’s oldest continuous open-air market. In the winter, students can go skiing and snowboarding in the nearby Pocono Mountains. The campus has its own indoor rock-climbing wall and on-campus night club called The Spot for year-round fun. There are about 250 student organizations, including a popular Greek system of close to a dozen fraternities and sororities. Each fraternity and sorority has a house on campus for member students. Freshmen must live on campus at the residential college, and so must sophomores, juniors, and most seniors. About 50 seniors who apply to move off campus will be approved each year. The Lafayette Leopards compete in the NCAA Division I Patriot League, and the football team has a notorious rival with Lehigh University’s squad. Students kick off the year with the President’s Ball, a formal dance, and end the year with All-College Day, a campus-wide celebration with music and food. Students can grab a bite after, too, when faculty members serve them Midnight Breakfast."

            "Le Moyne College is a Catholic, Jesuit institution offering comprehensive programs rooted in the liberal arts and sciences. Built on a rich 450-year-old Jesuit history of academic excellence, Le Moyne seeks to nurture the \"whole person.\" Its values-centered education prepares students for leadership and service by integrating community-based experiences with academic programs. This tradition - that intellectual effort can and should lead to action - helps students discover their place in life and applies knowledge toward making a difference. One of 28 Jesuit colleges and universities in the United States, Le Moyne's inclusive learning offers 32 majors and more than 40 programs in the arts, humanities, sciences, business and education. \r\n\r\nA teaching-centered College, Le Moyne provides a variety of multi-disciplinary research opportunities through internships and seminars. Le Moyne's undergraduate enrollment of 2,300 supports small classes with a student-to-teacher ratio of 13:1, a size that fosters a sense of community evident in its First-Year Residential Learning Communities.  Here, groups of students attend classes together and live in the same residence halls. They participate in social and cultural events as well as community service activities. All of these experiences closely integrate a student's academic and social life. \r\n\r\nIn remaining connected to the world at large, the College's Center for Peace and Global Studies allows students to link the educational process with ethics, values and globalization. Students and faculty take part in forums that spark debate on political and social issues.\r\n\r\nFor students who want a more concentrated academic program, the Integral Honors Program confers upon its graduates the highest degree Le Moyne offers. This challenging program requires seniors to complete a final honors project in collaboration with a faculty advisor.\r\n\r\nLe Moyne's outstanding programs are enhanced by its picturesque 160-acre campus. A state-of-the-art performing arts center and recreation center are places for students to relax and socialize.  In addition, the recreation center houses a competition size pool, jogging track, tennis, volleyball and racquetball courts, and a fitness center.  A member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), Le Moyne fields a total of 16 intercollegiate teams.  The men's baseball and women's lacrosse teams are NCAA Division I and the College's 14 other intercollegiate teams are NCAA Division II and compete in the Northeast-10 Athletic Conference. In 2007, 2006 and 2004, the men's lacrosse team captured the NCAA Division II title. In 2003, Le Moyne was honored with the USA Today/NCAA Academic Achievement Award, signifying the highest freshman graduation rate among nearly 300 Division II colleges and universities. \r\n\r\nBeyond the academic and social campus offerings, students at Le Moyne find its Central New York location a major attraction. Close to major cities such as New York, Toronto, Montreal and Boston, students take advantage of that proximity by attending Broadway plays, sightseeing and shopping. The abundance of lush country is evident in the numerous state parks and lakes, which offer additional recreational fun. And if that's not enough, Le Moyne has more than 70 clubs and organizations for students. \r\n\r\nWith Le Moyne's strong academic and community setting, students connect on all levels - local, regional and global.  Le Moyne's personal approach supports students in a rapidly changing world by developing their skills to meet future challenges and excel in both their personal and professional lives."

The Macalester campus is a 10-minute drive from both downtown St. Paul and Minneapolis, two hubs of theatres, museums, and outdoor activities known as the Twin Cities. Freshmen and sophomores must live on the Macalester campus. There is no Greek system at Macalester, but students can get involved in dozens of other clubs and organizations. The Macalester sports teams, known as the Scots, compete in the NCAA Division III Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. Football is not a big draw for student fans, but both the men’s and women’s soccer teams are competitive. Annual student events include Springfest and Founder’s Day, campus celebrations that include bagpipe music and food. Bagpipes are a common theme on campus; the instrument heralds the beginning and end of major events, and students can take bagpipe lessons for free. To get off campus, students can take a class each semester at one of the other private colleges in the Twin Cities:",

We want to develop servants of Christ who are disciplined, creative, and passionate about the field to which they have been called. Our passion is to instill a missionary vision and dedication to worldwide outreach and personal evangelism. Since 1968 Maranatha has emphasized a balanced approach to life. Each student must take significant Bible and liberal arts classes in addition to their major's requirements. Because students can serve the Lord in many ways, Maranatha offers majors in departments such as applied science, Bible, business, church ministries, education, fine arts, humanities, nursing, or ROTC. Our rigorous, interdisciplinary academics as well as excellent student to faculty ratio produce well rounded graduates. Maranatha's guiding core values stress fidelity to God and His Word, student learning that equips to serve with competence, integrity and moral excellence, charity and kindness to all, leadership and service to God and others, unity within diversity, educational balance, family, and the pursuit of excellence. As an NCAA III school, we offer opportunities to compete in football, soccer, basketball, baseball, softball, volleyball, cross-country and wrestling. Our fine arts department encourages the development of talent through orchestra, band, plays, choral groups, and ensembles. Our mission is to provide a comprehensive college education that is founded upon a valuable Bible core true to our Baptist heritage and that is set in a nurturing environment where serving the Lord while in college is encouraged and facilitated."

            "\"Marist is dedicated to helping students develop the intellect and character required for enlightened, ethical, and productive lives in the global community of the 21st century.\"\r\n\r\nThe College fulfills its mission by pursuing three ideals: excellence in education, the importance of community, and the principle of service. These ideals were handed down to us by the Marist Brothers who founded the College. Although Marist is now an independent institution governed by a lay board of trustees, the three ideals remain an integral part of the College mission.\r\n\r\nThe Marist ideal of excellence in education is achieved through an emphasis on quality teaching and distinctive learning opportunities. At the undergraduate level, this begins with a firm foundation in the liberal arts and sciences. Through core courses and their major field of study, students are educated to think logically and creatively, be able to synthesize and integrate methods and insights from a variety of disciplines, and effectively express their opinions both orally and in writing. Students are encouraged to consider the ethical dimensions of the subjects they study, and to become more aware of their own values and the value implications of the choices they make in their public and private lives. They are also exposed to cultures other than their own through on-campus programs and study abroad.\r\n\r\nIn addition to offering undergraduate programs to traditional-age students, Marist has a long history of serving the needs of adult learners for graduate, degree completion, and continuing education programs. The College offers these students an educational experience that meets the same high standards as our traditional undergraduate programs. Marist allows these students to balance their education with work and family responsibilities by offering flexible scheduling, alternative methods of program delivery, and satellite campuses.\r\n\r\nMarist seeks to distinguish itself by the manner in which it uses information technology to support teaching, learning, and scholarship at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. The College believes that by familiarizing our students with these advanced technologies, it better prepares them to be productive members of society and lifelong learners.\r\n\r\nThe Marist ideal of community is based on the belief that we become a better institution through the active involvement of faculty, staff, students, and alumni in the life of the College. At a time when social bonds in our society are tenuous, we seek to develop a relationship between our community members and the College that will last a lifetime. We do this by nurturing the development and well-being of all our community members. Of particular importance is assuring that the life of students outside the classroom is supportive of the educational goals pursued inside the classroom. We strive to be a diverse community but also one united by a shared commitment to the free exchange of ideas, consideration of the opinions of others, and civility in all our interactions.\r\n\r\nFinally, Marist believes in the dignity of every human being and is committed to the principle of service. The College conducts programs for the disadvantaged, a wide variety of programs that meet community needs, and programs that broaden access to education. We encourage students, faculty, staff, and alumni to make service an important part of their lives. Students are encouraged to become involved in campus activities, programs that assist the less fortunate in our society, and service projects throughout the Hudson River Valley and around the world. By sharing their time and talents, students help make Marist a better place to live and learn while developing a sense of personal and civic responsibility."

            "Life at Marquette University, a school named for a nearby freeway exchange, can be nearly as fast-paced as its namesake. The private Catholic, Jesuit school is in walking distance of downtown Milwaukee, a burgeoning city known for its restaurants, zoo, and athletics. The Marquette Golden Eagles are members of the NCAA Division I Big East Conference and are especially competitive in basketball. The men’s basketball team plays in the Bradley Center, which is also home to the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks. There is no varsity football team, but enthusiasts of the sport can play at the club and intramural levels. (Snow football is an intramural sport at Marquette, too.) Other unique sports options include coed club waterskiing and wakeboarding and intramural innertube water polo. Students have about 250 clubs and organizations to get involved in, and about 10 percent of the student body takes part in the Greek system, which includes more than 20 fraternities and sororities. To kick off each spring semester, the university holds the Winter Flurry, a week of games and activities that culminates in a semiformal dance known as Snowball. Freshmen and sophomores must live on campus, unless they reside locally with a family member or guardian. Lake Michigan is a mile from campus, and students can travel on Milwaukee County Transit System buses for free with school ID."

            "Founded in 1891 by the legislature as the Massachusetts Nautical Training School, the Massachusetts Maritime Academy is the oldest continuously operating maritime academy in the United States.\r\nThe Academy began as a floating maritime trade school aboard the school ship USS Enterprise, berthed next to the USS Constitution in Boston Harbor.  During its 117-year history, the Academy has grown from an entering class of 40 cadets to a fully accredited, four-year, coeducational college granting baccalaureate and master of science degrees and with an undergraduate enrollment of approximately 1,100.The, present name was assumed in 1942 when the Academy moved from Boston to a Hyannis campus on Cape Cod.  In 1946, the Academy was authorized by the legislature to grant the Bachelor of Science degree.  By 1948, after utilizing a variety of different training ships during World War II, the Academy obtained the USS Charleston.  The draft of the Charleston, a former U. S. Navy gunboat, exceeded the depth of Hyannis Harbor, so the campus was again moved, this time to its present location in the village of Buzzards Bay. \r\nThe present undergraduate academic programs feature six distinct majors and emphasize a blend of the liberal arts and sciences with technical and professional studies.  Graduates of the Academy???s two oldest programs, Marine Transportation and Marine Engineering, earn two fold credentials: a fully accredited Bachelor of Science degree, and a professional license as Third Mate or Third Assistant Engineer (both unlimited as to waters or vessel size).  While adhering firmly to its original mission as a maritime college, the Academy has diversified its degree offerings in response to a changing environment for higher education and the needs of a dynamic maritime industry.  The first degrees in Facilities and Plant Engineering (now Facilities Engineering) were awarded in 1993.  The first graduates of the Marine Safety and Environmental Protection program received the degree in 1995.  In 2004, the first Bachelor of Science in International Maritime Business degrees were awarded.  In 2008, the Academy awarded the first Bachelor of Science in Emergency Management.  Also in 2005, the first graduating class of the Academy???s first graduate program, the Master of Science in Facilities Management, received their diplomas.  In April 2007, the Massachusetts Board of Higher Education approved the Master of Science in Emergency Management, and the first cohort began in October 2007.  The first graduates of the Bachelor of Science in Emergency Management will receive their degrees in June 2009.  The Academy is accredited by the\r\nNew England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) and successfully completed a decennial reaccreditation in 2001.  The Master of Science in Facilities Management received NEASC accreditation in 2005.  The Academy???s campus and facilities are continually being upgraded better serving its students.  A campus beautification program, a multi-million dollar renovation of the dormitories and athletic facilities, an engineering laboratory addition to the Bresnahan Hall, a complete renovation of the Blinn Hall and a project to rebuild the pier has been completed over the past few years.  The USTS Enterprise has undergone a complete rebuilding into the nation???s newest and most modern maritime academy school ship and has successfully completed five Sea Term voyages."

            "Mercer University is one of America's oldest and most distinctive institutions of higher learning, offering rigorous programs that span the undergraduate liberal arts to doctoral-level degrees. Founded by early 19th century Baptists, Mercer - while no longer formally affiliated with the Baptist denomination - remains committed to an educational environment that embraces intellectual and religious freedom while affirming values that arise from a Judeo-Christian understanding of the world. Central to the Mercer experience is an education that uniquely prepares students to lead virtuous, meaningful and responsible lives and encourages a thoughtful examination of ethical and moral choices.  With more than 8,000 students enrolled in 11 schools and colleges on campuses in Macon, Atlanta and Savannah, and at three Regional Academic Centers around the state, Mercer is consistently ranked among the nation???s leading institutions by such publications as U.S. News & World Report and the Princeton Review. Its more than 65,000 alumni are making important contributions to their professions and communities throughout Georgia, the Southeast and the world. Ten Mercerians have served as governors -of the states of Alabama, Georgia, New Hampshire and Texas and of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico - and three alumni have served as U.S. Senators. Hundreds more have served as mayors, U.S. Representatives and state legislators.\r\nWhile offering a breadth of programs found at much larger universities, Mercer maintains an intimate, student-focused culture more characteristic of smaller liberal arts colleges. The institution operates one of only two engineering schools in the state of Georgia, one of only three pharmacy schools, one of only four medical schools, and one of only five law schools. It also offers nationally-regarded programs in liberal arts, business, music, education, and theology. In addition, Mercer has one of the more prominent university presses in the country, operates an engineering research center employing 200 scientists and engineers, and is the only private university in the state to field an NCAA Division I athletic program.  Among the University???s signature programs is Mercer On Mission, a unique blend of study abroad and service-learning that provides life-changing experiences for students through academic instruction, cultural immersion, meaningful service, and spiritual reflection.  Working alongside in-country partners, Mercer students and faculty are distributing mosquito nets and bringing water to villages in Africa, fitting amputees in Vietnam with low-cost prosthetic legs, teaching orphans in Guatemala, students in Liberia and the homeless in Brazil, and delivering much-needed medical care in Thailand."

            "Merrimack College is a selective private college in the Catholic, Augustinian tradition whose mission is to enlighten minds, engage hearts and empower lives. The College offers undergraduate degrees in four focused schools: liberal arts, science and engineering, education and business. Merrimack also serves adults through master???s programs in education and a range of certificate, licensure and degree completion offerings.  Merrimack???s approximately 2,000 full-time and 300 evening students represent 25 states and 17 countries.\r\n\r\nMerrimack is known for experiential learning and career preparation.

About 80 percent of Merrimack???s students live on campus, contributing to a strong sense of community.

There are more than 50 student clubs and activities, NCAA Division I men???s hockey, 15 men???s and women???s NCAA Division II sports, and active club and intramural sports.\r\n\r\nMerrimack has been ranked consistently high among peer institutions by U.S. News & World Report for more than a decade and has also been named one of the best colleges and universities in the Northeast by The Princeton Review.\r\n\r\nThe College has a 600 seat performing arts center, observatory, and two art galleries, one specifically for student work."

            "Miami University students make up nearly half the population of the 6-square mile town of Oxford, Ohio. Freshmen must live on campus, which is also home to about 500 student organizations. The Greek system constitutes a large part of campus life, with about a third of the student body involved in more than 50 fraternities and sororities. In fact, the school often gets the moniker “Mother of Fraternities” because the Beta Theta Pi, Delta Theta, and Sigma Chi organizations were founded at Miami University. The school is also known as the “Cradle of Coaches” for the number of professional and collegiate coaches who once competed as Miami RedHawks. The teams, who compete in the Division I Mid-American Conference, were known as the Redskins until 1997, when the Miami Indian Tribe complained. (The tribe is also the namesake of the university.) To help ease the transition into freshman year, older students often create a guide to life at Miami University, called the “M Book.” Student couples who marry are known as “Miami Mergers” and are reminded of their alma mater each Valentine’s Day, when the admissions office sends cards to congratulate former students on finding love at school."

            "For 125 years, Michigan Tech faculty have explored the boundaries of knowledge while mentoring undergraduate and graduate students to become citizens that improve our sustainable world. Michigan Tech students create the future in 130 degree programs in engineering; forest resources; computing; technology; business; economics; natural, physical and environmental sciences; arts; humanities; and social sciences. Students in our Enterprise Program work with industry sponsors on projects such as wakeboard design, homeland security, video games, environmental sustainability, hybrid SUVs (the only Michigan university chosen in the EcoCar competition), and nanosatellites. Business students won a national investment competition two years in a row, and the Clean Snowmobile Challenge team finished second overall in the annual international competition that they host. Programs such as Engineers Without Borders, Habitat for Humanity, and Make A Difference Day positively impact communities here and around the globe. Students have created safer football helmets on campus, cared for children in Ghana, helped with earthquake mitigation in Central America, and much more. In fact, Michigan Tech has the nation's largest Master's International Peace Corps program. University research covers a broad spectrum, from wolves and moose on Isle Royale to ion thrusters for NASA, and from computer modeling using gaming technologies to analysis of bridges. Undergraduate and grad students are routinely involved in research, and some of their recent work has looked at student sleep patterns, improved skeet shooting apparatus, and using grasses to remove antibiotics from groundwater. Research expenditures exceed $60 million annually. Our latest degree offerings include theatre and electronic media performance, and physical education. The environmental and mechanical engineering programs rank in the top ten nationally in enrollment. Environmental engineering and mechanical engineering rank in the top ten in degrees awarded. Our scientific and technical communication program is also among the nation's largest. Approximately 260 companies recruit students on campus annually, ensuring an average of five job interviews per student and an 87.5 percent placement rate, which will improve, as does the economy. Outside of classrooms and labs, students enjoy our eighteen-hole golf course; lighted ski hill, trails, and recreational forest; and small-town atmosphere in beautiful Upper Michigan. Our Winter Carnival features world-famous snow statues; and other annual celebrations include the Parade of Nations, with an international food festival; Keweenaw Day, an afternoon on Lake Superior's shore; and Spring Fling, one last on-campus celebration before finals. Our women's basketball team has advanced to the NCAA Division II Elite Eight two years in a row and has one of the nation's highest GPAs. We also have NCAA Division I men's ice hockey and Division II men's football; men's and women's basketball, tennis, track and field, Nordic skiing, and cross country; in addition to women's soccer and volleyball. Club sports include lacrosse, women's hockey, and paintball. The biggest game on campus, however, is broomball, where students slide around on ice and hit a rubber volleyball with a broom. You have to see it to believe it, and you can via our webcams. Overall, it's a great combination: an excellent education in a beautiful location."

            "For more than 100 years, Millikin University has been teaching students to perform their knowledge in the classroom, on the stage, in the laboratory, and in internships. Millikin students are passionate, eager, motivated learners who use what they've learned in professional settings before graduation -- becoming  better prepared for life after graduation. Millikin is a private, primarily undergraduate, 75-acre institution of 2,300 students. With four colleges and schools--the College of Arts and Sciences, Tabor School of Business, the College of Fine Arts, and the College of Professional Studies--and over 60 majors, minors, and pre-professional programs, Millikin prepares its students for professional success, democratic citizenship in a diverse and dynamic global environment, and a personal life of meaning and value. Millikin students learn to see the connections with other academic disciplines and understand the diversity of human experience, the interactions between technology and society.  Millikin students learn about themselves and others, developing a respect for differences and for the dignity of all.  Employers and graduate schools continue to prize Millikin graduates; 98% of Millikin's 2009 graduates gained professional employment or entered graduate/professional school within six months of graduation."

            "With a solid academic reputation and distinguished faculty who are accessible to students, Millsaps College is considered an ideally-sized living-learning environment where students develop into mature citizens with the intellectual capabilities, ethical principles, and sense of responsibility needed for leadership in all sectors of society.  Millsaps College offers a classroom experience that students have described as interactive--rather than just listen to a lecture, students are challenged to debate, discuss and ask questions.  Millsaps' programs are designed to cultivate critical-thinking and problem-solving skills; creativity, sensitivity, and tolerance; the ability to inform and challenge others; and an appreciation for humanity and the universe.  In addition, Millsaps offers a wide range of opportunities for professional research, internships, study abroad, and community service.  Since 1890, Millsaps has been committed to freedom of inquiry and expression in the classroom and on the campus. Its long-standing tradition of educating students in the arts and sciences was rewarded during the 20th century as it earned the privilege of establishing a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa and also being the first college in the state to earn this affiliation.\r\n\r\nMillsaps College is recognized for its strengths in liberal arts and business.  It is one of the few liberal arts colleges in the U.S. to hold both a Phi Beta Kappa chapter and accreditation at both the graduate and undergraduate level by AACSB International (The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business). Through its Else School of Management, Millsaps offers a five-year MBA to its business undergraduates and also provides a strongly supportive environment for its arts and sciences undergraduates to obtain masters degrees in business.\r\n\r\nMillsaps also understands the need for practical support of its students in their preparation for life-long vocations.  The Career Center offers strong counseling and placement services, while the Faith and Work program encourages students to explore careers that engage and inspire them through special service opportunities and student groups, a Meaning of work course, and internships, fellowships and other special programs."

Our faculty is accomplished, yet approachable, leading small classes where students are encouraged to think critically and explore creatively. Combining the strengths of academic excellence and leadership with personal, compassionate mentoring, we bring out the best in every student - here and around the globe. Through our Global-Learning Program, students study abroad, traveling to such exotic and enriching destinations as India, Thailand, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, and even Australia. Immersing themselves in another culture - for as little as a few weeks to an entire semester - students gain knowledge, while learning acceptance and understanding. The Molloy campus is alive and vibrant. Students have abundant opportunities to explore new interests, pursue career goals, and enrich our community.  At Molloy, there's a club or extracurricular activity for every interest. Whether it's participating in a music ensemble, writing for a campus publication, or serving as a student government representative, with more than 40 clubs and honor societies, Molloy has something for each and every student. Athletics and academics go hand-in-hand. For those who choose to combine athletic interest with scholastic success, Molloy offers a number of winning programs.

Colin Powell, the late Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto, humanitarian Paul Rusesabagina, and economist and editor of Newsweek International Fareed Zakaria have come to Molloy to focus on critical and timely issues.

            "Founded in 1853 as a co-educational frontier college with a traditional curriculum, Monmouth College emerged in the 20th century as a nationally recognized liberal arts college, praised for the friendliness of its campus and its strong academic programs, commitment to student-faculty collaboration, and outstanding faculty mentoring and advising. The college has earned respect among its peers for the impressive percentage of graduates who attend top graduate and professional schools and form successful careers in science, education, business and the arts. In the early 1990s, the trustees, faculty and administration began strategic discussions about ways to prepare the college for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. One result was extensive improvement of the physical plant, with the construction of new buildings, including residence halls and an athletic center, a substantially renovated and expanded library, and the completion of significant upgrades to campus grounds. Today, the Monmouth campus is acclaimed for its beauty and for facilities that surpass those of most comparable colleges. Further improvements are on the horizon. In addition to its intimate, friendly atmosphere and its beautiful campus, Monmouth's Scottish heritage gives it a unique ambiance. A first-class bagpipe band ushers in new students at their matriculation ceremony, marches them from center stage at commencement, and plays at campus functions such as homecoming and honors convocation. Monmouth's signature is its focus on \"integrated learning.\" Monmouth faculty are certain that integrated, interdisciplinary learning will be central to the liberal arts curriculum of the future. Consequently, Monmouth has implemented an innovative general education program, a sequence of courses including the first-year Introduction to the Liberal Arts, the sophomore Global Perspectives, Reflections in the junior year, and the senior capstone, Citizenship. The ability to connect ideas across disciplines, to move from one disciplinary perspective to another, and to understand the contributions of each is a hallmark of the Monmouth graduate. Monmouth's integrated studies curriculum prepares students to meet the challenges of the complex society they will enter. Concentration in a major remains important, but the intellectually ambitious student looking toward success in science, law, industry, politics, education or the arts must understand how the disciplines work together, how domains of knowledge complement each other. Monmouth is now embarked upon a major construction project, the Integrated Learning Center for the Sciences and Business, which will bring together biology, chemistry, mathematics, computer science, physics, psychology, economics, business and accounting faculty and students for collaborative coursework and research. In today's world, business and science converge, but most graduates lack the background needed to understand how scientific discoveries move from the research lab to the marketplace. Through experiential, integrative education, we give our students opportunities to develop the requisite critical and analytical skills. A complementary characteristic of Monmouth College's academic program is the emphasis we place upon each student as an individual and upon \"engaged learning\" through opportunities for interactions among students, with dedicated professors, and in well-designed co-curricular programs and activities. The college continues to focus on admitting good students, teaching and advising them well, and providing them with opportunities to be challenged and changed by new ideas, new experiences, and new opportunities for intellectual engagement and personal growth."

Regardless of major, highly qualified students may be invited to join the Honors School. Additionally, the Monmouth Medical Scholars Program offers New Jersey residents a competitive seamless route to medical school.\r\n Experiential education, identified more frequently as an internship or cooperative learning, is a required part of the undergraduate curriculum-another way Monmouth separates itself from many other universities. Monmouth University is located in the New York metropolitan area-home to many prominent firms that are leaders in the technology, media, and financial industries. This proximity allows access to exceptional hands-on learning opportunities.\r\n Monmouth students enjoy the best of both worlds. The campus, located in West Long Branch, New Jersey, is minutes from the Atlantic Ocean and only one hour from New York City or Philadelphia. Students enjoy the beautiful, 156-acre campus yet they have easy access to some of the finest cultural events and job opportunities in the world.\r\n Monmouth University believes that in addition to providing sound preparation for successful careers, a major goal of higher education is to help students develop lasting values. These values include a keen sense of citizenship, social responsibility, and leadership qualities that equip graduates to contribute to today's increasingly complex and multicultural world. \r\n The University also provides a safe and secure environment for all students.  With a modern, community-oriented police department staffed by highly experienced and educated professionals, the campus is equipped with up-to-date technology, including emergency telephones throughout campus and a cell phone message service that sends out immediate alerts regarding emergency situations."

            "At Belmont Abbey College, you will find a campus that is physically beautiful, an atmosphere that is welcoming, and classes that stimulate students??? minds and cultivate their spirits. The College community is characterized by its academic strength, spiritual heritage, competitive athletics, and vibrant campus life. An Abbey education, grounded in the liberal arts, teaches a person how to seek the truth and to learn what is true, good and beautiful. This background, combined with the specialized work that each student does in his or her major and in a variety of co-curricular activities, equips Abbey graduates to lead lives of integrity, to succeed professionally, to become responsible citizens, and to be a blessing to themselves and others. The Catholic Benedictine traditions on which the College was founded over 130 years ago inform all aspects of campus life. Benedictine monks take three vows: stabilitas, conversatio morum, and obedienti. Translated simply, they mean stability of life, constantly turning towards and being improved by God???s grace, and hearing and responding to the word of God. Belmont Abbey College provides a stable environment in which students, faculty, and staff listen, discuss, learn, and grow. At the Abbey, we like to think that John Henry Newman???s motto, ???heart speaks to heart,??? describe faculty-student relationships. Beginning with the First-Year Symposium, a required course for all first year students, the College engages in a targeted approach to introducing students to the Benedictine mission and to collegiate academics. Common summer readings and whole-class activities enrich the student's experience in small-class settings. The course also helps students develop skills that are necessary to meet the academic demands of the College and helps them to adjust to their new learning community. The Abbey???s Honors Institute offers another example of our commitment to academic strength. The Honors Institute of Belmont Abbey College is a four-year program that provides qualified students a wide range of unique curricular, co-curricular, and extra-curricular experiences. The Honors Institute curriculum features courses in which students read and discuss some of the greatest and most influential texts of ancient, Christian, and modern writers. Extensive cultural experiences, independent study research, and the Honors Institute Seminar all provide a unique opportunity that challenge students to pursue clarity of expression and depth of thought. Our commitment to excellence and virtue extends beyond academics to extra-curricular experiences as well. Established in 1883, the Abbey???s theater is one of the oldest continuously operating theaters in the Southeast. The Abbey Players and Belmont Community Theatre present six productions a year, including dramas, stylish comedies, major musicals, and a Shakespearean production. Recent productions have included the musical Into the Woods, the comedy The Boys Next Door, A Man for All Seasons, and Macbeth. The Abbey Chorus, Belmont Abbey Quintet, and Carolina Pro Musica (an instrumental group that plays pre-1800 music on historic instruments) are also active on campus. Students at Belmont Abbey College also demonstrate strength in the athletic arena???with nine men???s sports and eight women???s sports teams competing successfully in Division II Conference Carolinas. The motto of Conference Carolinas is ???Academics and athletics working together,??? and that reflects Belmont Abbey College???s view as well. In fact, the College demonstrates this commitment in the new movement, SPD (Sport Properly Directed), where the vision is to put sportsmanship back into athletics and to reclaim the game. At the Abbey, student athletes are challenged to perform to their full potential???physically, mentally and spiritually."

            "Although the town of Beloit, Wis. may be best known for having the world’s largest can of chili, Wisconsin’s oldest college also resides here. Beloit College, located 90 miles northwest of Chicago and about an hour south of Milwaukee, is nestled on a 40-acre, New England-style campus situated on river bluffs and surrounded by American Indian mounds. On campus, students have many opportunities to get involved in activities, with more than 100 student-run clubs and organizations and over 20 fraternities and sororities. Beloit College competes in the Division III Midwest Conference and sponsors 19 intercollegiate varsity teams. Intramural, club, and varsity sports are very popular at Beloit, with about 70 percent of students taking part in athletics. Nearly all students live on campus during their entire college career, but students have opportunities to travel away from the area. About half of all Beloit students study abroad in places such as Brazil, China, Germany, and many other countries. Although this campus is located in the Midwest, Beloit’s student population has an international flavor. About 10 percent of the students are from countries outside the United States and, each year, students have the opportunity to share their cultural experiences through an event called International Symposium, a day when classes are cancelled so everyone can attend the presentations."

            "Benedictine College - TRADITION OF EXCELLENCE\r\n\r\n- Wangari Maathai, Class of '64, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004. \r\n- Benedictine College was named one of the top 20 Catholic colleges in America by the Newman Guide to Choosing a Catholic College.  \r\n- We were named a best buy in faithfulness and affordability by the Center for the Study of Catholic Higher Education. \r\n- The Benedictine Education Department was nationally recognized by the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education. \r\n- Benedictine College is home to the Discovery Program, a dynamic experiential learning program that fosters student research beyond the classroom.  \r\n- About 70 percent of our students majoring in natural sciences continue in graduate and professional schools (nearly twice the national average). \r\n- The Chamber Singers, a select choir, has traveled to Italy many times, singing from Venice to Rome and even for the Pope. \r\n- More than 85 percent of our classes have fewer than 20 students. \r\n- We are one of the few Catholic liberal arts schools in the country to offer an Engineering major and one of only 70 colleges overall to offer an Astronomy major. \r\n\r\nBenedictine College is located in Atchison, Kansas on a beautiful 110 acre campus on the bluffs overlooking the Missouri River. The college's commitment to the development of the individual within community provides our students with the principles, knowledge and skills for a life of learning, leadership and service, \"that in all things God may be glorified.\"  \r\n\r\nMISSION\r\nHeir to the 1500 years of Benedictine dedication to learning, the Benedictine College mission  as a Catholic, Benedictine, liberal arts, residential college is the education of men and women within a community of faith and scholarship.\r\n\r\nWHAT MAKES US BENEDICTINE\r\nThe two sponsoring institutions of Mount St. Scholastica Monastery and St. Benedict's Abbey are both Benedictine communities and the presence of the sisters and monks on the faculty, in administration, and just on campus brings the Rule of St. Benedict to the forefront on a daily basis.  There are 10 core  values from the Rule on which Benedictine College builds its foundation.  In addition, the entire institution is guided by the vision of building one of the great Catholic colleges in America."

            "The principle of learning by practice underlies every major feature of a Bennington education: the master-apprentice model of teaching and learning; the requirement that students direct the course of their own education; the winter Field Work Term (an annual seven-week internship term), which gives students work experience and connects them to the greater community. The College's commitment to learning across the disciplines extends to the faculty, who teach what is uppermost in their minds, exploring new pursuits as well as ongoing areas of study and work. Bennington is grounded in the conviction that as a college education develops students' professional capacities; it should also prepare them to be deeply thoughtful and actively engaged citizens of the world.\r\nBennington's curriculum is shaped by the diverse range of the faculty's experience and expertise, including all of the traditional liberal arts disciplines and the visual and performing arts. A student progresses through Bennington by integrating different areas of the curriculum around central ideas or questions, newly discovered and ongoing. This method of integration is called the Plan Process and is the heart of a Bennington education. The areas of concentration that result differ from traditional majors in that students have developed their own programs of study, working closely with the faculty."

            "Berry College challenges students to embrace a firsthand education uniting strong academic programs with opportunities for meaningful work experience, spiritual and moral growth, and significant service to others. One of Berry's many distinguishing features is its campus, which spans more than 26,000 acres of meadows, woodlands, hills and watersheds in Northwest Georgia. This amazing environment provides endless opportunities for study and research, relevant work experience, recreation and exploration, and nurturing one's spirit. A member of the Annapolis Group of leading liberal arts colleges, Berry offers programs in the sciences, humanities, arts and social sciences as well as the professional areas of business and teacher education. All are characterized by high academic expectations and extraordinary mentoring relationships between faculty and students. Science students, for example, conduct sophisticated research projects alongside faculty members in first-rate laboratories; in field projects involving the wildlife and forests of Berry's ecosystem; and in on-campus equine, dairy and beef facilities. As a result, opportunities for those studying animal science and environmental science are among the nation's best. Students in the humanities and social sciences also flourish, working closely with faculty to complete major projects while distinguishing themselves though participation in Berry's highly accomplished forensics, Model U.N., College Bowl, communication and fine arts programs. Education students have the opportunity to hone their teaching skills at Berry's on-campus elementary/middle school and child development center, while business students apply what they have learned through collaborative research projects and other relevant activities. As a result of the unique blend of conceptual and practical learning that Berry offers, students who wish to do so regularly gain admission to graduate programs and professional schools nationwide. Students also benefit from the experience they gain through voluntary participation in the nation's premier Work Experience Program. Every student is eligible for a paid position on campus, regardless of family income. First-year work opportunities often involve service to the campus community. Upper-level positions offer increased levels of responsibility involving supervision, project management and technical expertise. There are more than 300 different types of jobs available, including positions in research laboratories, information technology, business offices, facilities and land resources, the equine and dairy centers, residence life and campus leadership, recreation and fitness, campus communications, public relations and marketing, and outdoor adventure. In addition, Berry offers a vibrant program of campus activities and intramural sports, many of which are student initiated and managed, as well as a successful intercollegiate athletic program that is currently transitioning to NCAA Division III. A new initiative, Student-Operated Campus Enterprises, has earned national acclaim by providing participants from various majors with the opportunity to work together in support of a specific product or service. The college also supports and encourages student entrepreneurship and community service. From the first semester they arrive on campus, students are asked to consider what it means to live a worthy life, one that makes a difference, through a structured planning process and an ongoing schedule of campus speakers, concerts and events. An independent, coeducational college of approximately 1,900 students, Berry is grounded in Christian values and a Christian perspective. Our belief is that a college education should involve the whole person, and we invite students from all backgrounds to enjoy the benefits of an educational experience that is both comprehensive and purposeful."

            "Going to college is about much more than earning a degree, or at least it should be. At Bethel, we want our students to become truly educated: to understand, with depth and insight, the world and their place in it. Students find that Bethel drives them to think deeply and to work diligently, taking into account their particular strengths and goals.  You will learn to evaluate ideas, to draw on ethics and values and to discern among theories and judgments you encounter every day.  It can be challenging, but Bethel offers the resources you need to succeed.  Bethel offers a true education in another powerful way as well. Our mission as a Christian college of the arts and sciences is to foster spiritual insight, growth and commitment.  Faith gives fuller dimension to the learning that takes place here.  You can see the whole picture.  You can know the truth.\r\nAs a Christian college of the arts, sciences, and professions, Bethel can provide you with skills you will use throughout your lifetime: effective communication, resourceful problem solving, solid teamwork and critical thinking. The solid preparation built into a Bethel education means that students in every program enjoy exceptional success as they pursue their career or graduate school. Bethel offers more than 50 areas of study, so students are able to study what they love and put it to use in the real world. An internship program allows you to gain valuable experience prior to graduation.  Students at Bethel quickly learn that their college education is not limited to the four walls of the classroom. Bethel offers educational opportunities across the country and around the world. Such opportunities include the American Studies Program in Washington, DC; Au Sable Institute of Environmental Studies in Michigan and Florida; the Pacific Rim Program in Australia, New Zealand, and China; and the Los Angeles Film Studies Center in California.  Bethel's campus is home to a variety of community-focused ministries, including tutoring children, building houses, feeding the hungry and the annual Work Day, which serves the Mishawaka/South Bend community. If students have a heart for missions, they can join a Task Force Team and reach out to others in places around the world. Mishawaka/South Bend, an active residential community in Northern Indiana, is an excellent location for your education.  Beautiful buildings blend gracefully on our campus, which features stately oaks and cascading fountains. You will enjoy the safety and serenity of an established suburban setting. We are located in the third largest metro area in the state, so you can also find big-city advantages within easy reach. Chicago is just 90 miles away. You can pursue a great internship or job at a major business, health care facility, church, social service agency or governmental office, all easily accessible from campus."

            "Outdoor recreation abounds in the southeastern New York location of Binghamton University. Despite its name, the university is actually located in Vestal, N.Y., a suburb of Binghamton. The campus encompasses 887 acres of land including a nature preserve, complete with a forest and pond where students can hike, bike, and run around. Through the Adventure Resource Center and the Outdoor Pursuits program, students can participate in organized kayaking, climbing and camping trips, or can plan an excursion of their own. Winter sports fans can go skiing and snowboarding at Greek Peak, a 30-mile trip from campus. On campus, annual student events include University Fest and Spring Fling, two outdoor celebrations with live music, carnival rides, and food. There are more than 250 student organizations, including 55 recognized fraternities and sororities. Freshmen must live on campus, and, because of space restrictions, no graduate students are permitted to do so. One perk of living in the school’s residence facilities: free laundry. The Binghamton Bobcats compete in the NCAA Division I America East Conference, and student fans form the BU Zoo cheering section during basketball games. The school mascot is a bearcat named Baxter. On average, more than nine in 10 students remain at SUNY Binghamton after freshman year, one of the highest first-year retention rates in the country."

The school does not have a Greek system, but students can choose from more than 150 clubs and organizations. At Mount Holyoke, a residential college, all student must live on campus. Juniors and seniors with a compelling reason to move off campus must apply and be approved. One perk of life in the residence halls: through a tradition known as Elfing, first-year students receive a week’s worth of gifts from an anonymous sophomore. Another campus tradition may be less fun: All first-year students must work at least one shift in the dining halls. On the sports fields, the Mount Holyoke Lyons compete in the NCAA Division III New England Women’s and Men’s Athletic Conference. The sports teams get their name from school founder Mary Lyon, and the mascot is a costumed lion named Paws. Mount Holyoke women can also get a workout outdoors, as the college near to skiing, hiking, and biking options. For a road trip, Boston is an hour and a half away by car."

            "Mount Mercy College, located in Cedar Rapids, is a Catholic college in the Mercy tradition that provides a diverse group of students a practical and relevant foundation for leading successful, meaningful lives. An engaged and welcoming campus community, Mount Mercy offers students a learning environment that is deeply personal while providing academically challenging courses and vibrant programs and experiences. Established by the Sisters of Mercy in 1928, Mount Mercy has grown in size and reputation as a premier college of choice, offering students a personalized, challenging, engaging and practical education. Under the direction of President Christopher R.L. Blake, Ph.D., who joined Mount Mercy in July 2006, the institution began offering graduate programs in business and education, as well as continuing to provide 36 major areas of study for baccalaureate programs. The Mount Mercy Board of Trustees recently adopted a new strategic plan, and endorsed the goal of Mount Mercy College transitioning to Mount Mercy University by 2012. The strategic plan focuses on five major themes: a vibrant teaching and learning environment; student experiences; sustainable institutional resources; visibility, marketing and outreach; and Catholic identity and Mercy mission. Mount Mercy is home to more than 1,600 traditional age students, transfer students, adult accelerated students and graduate students. The institution's talented and dedicated faculty blend a liberal arts education with professional preparation while encouraging students to strive for excellence through service to the common good, strategic communication, reflective judgment, and purposeful living. Mount Mercy is distinguished by graduates committed to service, both in their choice of career and personal volunteer service to the community. Of graduates over the past three years: 96% are in employed or in graduate school within six months of graduation; 43% remain in the Cedar Rapids metropolitan area; and 74% remain in Iowa to work, live and serve. Mount Mercy College provides students with a quality education grounded in service to the common good.  Mount Mercy's emphasis on practicum and internship experiences opens doors to full-time employment following graduation and prepares students for the challenges of the working world.  Students on \"the Mount\" benefit from a vibrant campus environment and active student life. Mount Mercy is a great place to be a student-athlete, succeeding in the classroom and on the field. Our intercollegiate teams, the Mount Mercy Mustangs, compete in the NAIA Division II as members of the Midwest Collegiate Conference. The Mustangs own more than 35 conference championships and numerous 43 NAIA National tournament appearances. If you enjoy competition in a less structured environment, try intramural sports like basketball, volleyball, golf, flag football, and softball, or choose from more than 35 campus clubs and organizations.

            "Long considered one of the nation's strongest regional academic institutions, Muskingum's enthusiasm for the future has never been stronger. Muskingum has experienced a period of intensive strategic planning and resource development. This endeavor has resulted in sound financial growth, effective resource investment, and unprecedented campus construction - and has been noted in BusinessWeek magazine, The Chronicle of Higher Education, and featured on National Public Radio.  The effects of such planning are tangible across campus. Over the past nine years, the University's enrollment has expanded from 1,800 to more than 3,000 undergraduate and graduate students. Under the leadership of President Dr. Anne C. Steele, Muskingum has entered a period of intensive growth and renewal in facilities. These include three  new, state-of-the-art campus landmarks: Philip and Betsey Caldwell Hall, the 32,000 square-foot home of speech, theatre, electronic journalism and communications programs, dedicated in 2004; the Walter K. Chess Center, the 22,000 square-foot home of student activities, fitness, and recreation, dedicated in 2008; and Otto and Fran Walter Hall, the 30,000 square-foot home for music, foreign languages and the Center for the Advancement of Learning, currently under construction. Completed ???campus of the future??? facilities projects also include the newly-constructed Ruth and John Neptune Art Center and multi-million dollar renovations and restorations to Muskingum's athletic complex and historic academic buildings. Offering more than 40 undergraduate and interdisciplinary majors, including Nursing, Engineering Science and Graphic Design and  10 pre-professional programs, three master's degree programs, and the Muskingum Adult Program, the university serves the east central Ohio community and beyond. Muskingum's mission is to develop - intellectually, spiritually, socially and physically - whole persons, by fostering critical thinking, position action, ethical sensitivity and spiritual growth.  Muskingum meets student where they are, helping each to discover his or her own potential. Small class sizes and the personal attention of an exceptional and dedicated faculty create an atmosphere of success and achievement. Founded in 1837 by Presbyterians of Scotch-Irish descent, Muskingum continues to be associated with the Presbyterian Church (USA) and takes its church-relatedness very seriously, offering courses in religion and philosophy and a full complement of religious-life programs. Many 20th-century national and world leaders are among Muskingum's alumni:  pioneer astronaut and U.S. Senator John Glenn; Ford Motor Company CEO Philip Caldwell; Depository Trust Company Founder and CEO William Dentzer; U.S. Ambassador and Goodyear Tire CEO Charles Pilliod; Robert Warner, the Sixth Archivist of the United States; AT&T Executive Vice President Harold Burlingame; and Jack Hanna, television zoologist.  Nineteenth-century alumni include William Rainey Harper, founding President of the University of Chicago."

            "Founded in 1924 and located on a close-knit, suburban campus in the dynamic, metropolitan region of Rochester, N.Y., Nazareth College's challenging academic programs and strong cultures of service and community prepare students to be successful professionals and engaged citizens. With approximately 2,200 undergraduate and 1,100 graduate students, Nazareth offers undergraduate and graduate studies in the liberal arts and sciences along with professional programs in education, management, and health and human services. \r\n\r\nMany of the College's majors lead to careers in fields experiencing job growth, including physical therapy, nursing, education, and marketing. Career preparation is an integral part of education at Nazareth and 84 percent of 2006 graduates were either employed or enrolled in graduate school within one year of graduating. The faculty is dedicated to student-centered learning, and the College boasts an average class size of 19 students. The College's strong commitment to experience-based learning is evinced through its internship programs, student teaching opportunities, and curriculum-based field experience. In fact, 75 percent of Nazareth students have experiential learning within their academic field and 91 percent of Nazareth undergraduates participate in community service while they are students. \r\n\r\nNazareth is one of few schools to have an on-campus Center for Service-Learning, assisting faculty to incorporate service into the curriculum. And for the fourth year in a row, Nazareth was honored with a place on the President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll for exemplary service efforts and service to America's communities. U.S. News & World Report ranks Nazareth in the top tier of colleges and universities in the category of Universities-Masters's, North Region, in its 2010 America's Best Colleges guide. In addition, Nazareth has been recognized by The Princeton Review in its \"Best 371 Colleges: 2010 Edition.\" Nazareth is one of only approximately 10 percent of all U.S. colleges named to the list. \r\n\r\nEducation coupled with professional preparation characterizes academic life at Nazareth, but student life is also significant. Students may participate on 23 Division III varsity sports teams--from lacrosse to equestrian--and have a choice of living options that feature suites, cafes, and free laundry. \r\n\r\nThey are encouraged to explore study abroad opportunities and Nazareth's Center for International Education has partnerships with institutions in many countries, including Australia, France, Italy, Japan, and Peru. According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, Nazareth is number four on the list of top producers of Fulbright Scholars among master's institutions--further demonstrating the global impact of our students and faculty. \r\n\r\nUndergraduate students are also offered free tickets to the renovated Nazareth College Arts Center and its world-class season series events. Nazareth is committed to supporting and enhancing the visual and performing arts at the College and in the region: The Princeton Review ranks Nazareth's theater programming sixth in the nation. \r\n\r\nThe College is located on 150 scenic acres near Rochester, N.Y., the third largest city in the state. Area attractions include the George Eastman House, Memorial Art Gallery, and the New York Wine and Culinary Center. Outdoor enthusiasts enjoy jogging and cycling along the Erie Canal; skiing and snowboarding at nearby Bristol Mountain or Swain Resort; and boating, canoeing, and kayaking on Lake Ontario or the Finger Lakes. The city also hosts a variety of annual festivals, including the Rochester International Jazz Festival, Lilac Festival, and 360 | 365 George Eastman House Film Festival. Day and weekend trips to the Finger Lakes and Canada are also options, and help round out the Nazareth College experience."

            "Located in the heart of New York's Greenwich Village, The New School is a center of academic excellence where intellectual and artistic freedoms thrive. The nearly 9,400 matriculated students and approximately 5,280 continuing education students who attend the university's eight schools enjoy a disciplined education supported by small class sizes, superior resources, and renowned working faculty members who practice what they teach. Artists, scholars, and students from all walks of life attend its diverse programs and can earn everything from program certificates to bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees. When The New School was founded in 1919, its mission was to create a place where global peace and justice were more than theoretical ideals. New School students participate in programs that to this day strive for academic excellence, technical mastery, and engaged world citizenship. The eight schools that make up The New School are: The New School for General Studies; The New School for Social Research; Milano, The New School for Management and Urban Policy; Parsons, The New School for Design; Eugene Lang College, The New School for Liberal Arts; Mannes College, The New School for Music; The New School for Drama; and The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music.

            "Founded in 1861, North Central College is an independent, comprehensive college and a community of learners dedicated to preparing informed, involved, principled and productive citizens and leaders over a lifetime. North Central College offers 60 undergraduate majors and graduate programming in six areas. With 2,200 full-time undergraduates and 540 part-time undergraduate and graduate students, North Central College is committed to academic excellence, a climate that emphasizes leadership, ethics, values and service, a curriculum that balances job-related knowledge with a liberal arts foundation and a caring environment with small classes. North Central College is affiliated with the United Methodist Church.\r\nLocated in the historic district of Naperville, Illinois, identified as one of the nation's best places to live, North Central College is just 30 minutes from Chicago's Loop. This proximity to Chicago provides students with access to world class cultural opportunities and internships but also allows North Central College to build unique programs that set it apart from other schools.\r\nThe all-college requirements include seminars in religion and ethics, intercultural issues and leadership, ethics and values--important components to the integrative curriculum. Students study in programs like interactive media relations or urban and suburban studies. Some classes are team taught by faculty from two different disciplines, emphasizing how to negotiate differences of opinion, culture and reason. North Central's nationally recognized conflict resolution program serves as a model for professional training, peer mediation and community outreach. Faculty and students collaborate across every field of study through faculty-directed research, on-campus seminars, fieldwork and independent study.\r\nA North Central College education is much more than attending classes and accumulating enough of the right credits to receive a diploma. Some of the most valuable educational experiences take place outside of the classroom: in various extracurricular activities, on the athletic field, or in conversations that arise spontaneously between students and professors. Students and professors often communicate about ideas and issues at a depth not possible within the structure of course schedules and timetables. Students can participate in Chicago Term, an urban immersion program in Chicago that provides an opportunity to learn about the city through classes, internships, exciting field study and service projects. North Central students are also encouraged to study abroad and experience life in a culture beyond the national boundaries--on five continents, from a three-week seminar to a full-year program.\r\nService learning at North Central College includes community based projects and alternative spring break programs that send hundreds of students out to support service projects, ranging from building Habitat for Humanity houses to urban plunge in New York City. Another unique program is sponsored by Students in Free Enterprise, where students visit Guatemalan coffee farmers to study about social justice issues. The result was bringing \"NCC's Best\" coffee to the campus coffeehouse in support of free trade.\r\nNCC offers more than 50 clubs and organizations providing opportunities such as art, music, theatre as well as honor societies. Students also work at North Central's award winning radio station, WONC-FM 89.1, which has received both Marconi College Radio and Silver Dome Awards in the past 10 years.  No other college radio station in the U.S. has won more. More than 600 North Central students participate in one of 22 intercollegiate sports and the Cardinals rank seventh in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III for the number of national championships won--with 24 national titles and nearly 100 individual national title champions. Cardinal pride is a way of life at North Central College."

            "At Northeastern University, students gain substantial work experience before receiving their diplomas. Nine in 10 Northeastern undergraduates complete at least one professional co-op during their college career, working for one of 2,380 employers around the world, such as GEICO and MTV. Students can choose to complete their degree in four years, with the potential for two co-ops, or five years, building in time for three co-ops. While students pay for eight semesters of tuition in either scenario, one in six students now opts to graduate in four years. Outside of the classroom and workplace, there are more than 250 clubs and organizations for students, including about 25 fraternities and sororities. The Northeastern Huskies compete in the NCAA Division I Colonial Athletic Conference. An additional 9,500 students compete at the club and intramural sport level. Freshmen are not required to live on campus, though more than 95 percent choose to do so. Northeastern’s campus is spread out across 73 acres in the venerable college town of Boston. Northeastern has its own stop on Boston’s subway system, commonly called the T. The city, home to myriad colleges, is steeped in American history and full of activities for students."

            "Why do we say \"Northern.  Naturally.\" at Northern Michigan University?  Well, there are the snowy peaks.  And the crashing waves.  And the more than 400 miles of rivers and streams just minutes from your residence hall door.  But we also say it because you may find the fit so perfect - so natural - you'll never want to leave.  And at Northern, learning comes naturally, thanks to the great outdoors that serves as a natural extension of the classroom.\r\n\r\nAt Northern, your future will come clearly into focus.  That's what happens when you're surrounded by people who want what you want: Your success.  Northern, after all, is known for having faculty who aren't just smart (though most have doctorates or are leaders in their fields), but who are caring people who will provide you with the personal attention you need to get where you want to go in life.  We offer 180 degree programs, so we're sure to have the area of study you're most passionate about.\r\n\r\nRecognized by U.S. News and World Report's ranking of America's Best Colleges, Northern is a dynamic regional public university (located in the Upper Peninsula - or the \"U.P.\") on the southern shore of Lake Superior in Marquette, Michigan (pop. 20,714).  The city was named one of 30 \"America's Most Livable Communities.\"  It's also one of Michigan's \"Cool Cities\" - and Marquette County received the National Civic League's \"All-America County Award.\"\r\n\r\nOur 350-acre campus and the surrounding area serve as a natural extension of our classrooms.  When you're researching mercury contamination in loons, you won't just look at pictures - you'll see these birds up close.  Our Freshman Fellows program pairs selected fellows with a faculty member for collaborative research.  And, thanks to our First Year Experience program, you'll get off to a great start at Northern.  On campus, you'll learn in places like our state-of-the-art Seaborg Science Complex, which has more than two dozen labs, and our beautiful Thomas Fine Arts facility, with exquisitely acoustic Wenger practice studios, and our sophisticated Art and Design facility, which was recognized by the American Institute of Architects.  Our library is award winning, too - and our sports and recreation complex includes the Superior Dome, the largest wooden dome in the world.  The United States Olympic Education Center (USOEC) makes Northern one of only four Olympic training centers in the nation - and the only one located on a college campus.  Northern's campus has everything within walking distance.  When the winter winds are blowing, you and your friends will stay warm - thanks to the enclosed walkways that connect many of our buildings.\r\n\r\nAnd at Northern, we keep you naturally connected.  Northern's Teaching, Learning and Communication Initiatve (TLC) made us the first public university in Michigan to equip all full-time students with a ThinkPad (or MacBook for art majors) - loaded with the latest software - as part of tuition and fees.  In fact, we guarantee you'll never have a computer that's more than two years old.  Northern is one of the largest computer notebook campuses in the United States.  We've even earned national and international awards for innovation in technology.\r\n\r\nAnd sometimes the best way to learn is by doing - even by getting your hands a little dirty.  That's why Northern offers tons of opportunities for you to get real-world experience - before you have to enter the real world.  Maybe it's heading out to a white pine forest to study the nesting habits of bald eagles.  Or using the Dimension 1200 SST machine in the Human Centered Design Studio to create a plastic prototype of the funky coat rack you designed first as a three-dimensional computer model.  Perhaps it's preparing for a career in broadcasting using cutting-edge technology like ProTools HD and Final Cut Pro.  Or maybe it's interning with the Green Bay Packers or a senator in Washington, D.C."

            "The mission of North Park University is to prepare students for lives of significance and service. North Park offers a distinctively Christian, intentionally urban, and purposefully multicultural educational experience. Forty years ago North Park declined an offer to relocate to the far north suburbs of Chicago, deciding instead to stay, invest, and take advantage of a unique urban setting. The amazingly rich international and multi-cultural neighborhood of North Park, the presence of global corporations, and world class cultural resources of Chicago, attract students as well as exceptionally qualified faculty devoted to teaching.\r\n\r\nRooted in the Christian tradition, the educational North Park offers is both profound and practical, balances freedom and disciplined responsibility, and is formational and transformational of the whole person. The common curriculum which all students take is built around some of the great questions of life, including: Who am I? What is Justice? What is true? What is a life of significance? Who is my Neighbor? North Park students develop into men and women with a passion to contribute to the common good of the planet in wide ranging careers in business, health care, government, education and the non-profit sector, including Christian ministries and the church. Students who are successful at North Park are regularly admitted into top graduate programs around the world immediately following college as well as within three to five years of graduation. Graduates from the North Park pre-med program have had an 85% admission rate into medical schools for the last twenty years.\r\n\r\nThe campus is located on a beautiful, award winning, park-like 30 acre campus in a vibrant and culturally diverse Chicago neighborhood. Four bus routes border the campus and the Brown Line of the train system stops just two blocks away. A student owned automobile is not necessary. Four residence halls house 600 students and another 525 students live in school owned houses and apartments on the campus.\r\n\r\nNorth Park is a complexly diverse university, welcoming undergraduate students from 40 states and 27 countries. Diversity is evidenced in terms of socio-economic factors, race and ethnicity, and the faith background of students. \r\n\r\n37 undergraduate majors and 26 minors are supplemented by another several special programs and pre-professional programs.\r\n\r\nThe Honors Congress is designed for high ability students and provides mentoring and enrichment in a variety of ways, including coaching and mentoring for national scholarship competitions. In 2008, 2009, and 2010, a total of four North Park students have been awarded international Fulbright Scholarships for their year following graduation."

            "Northwest Missouri State University is a learning-centered institution founded in 1905 as a normal school to train teachers for 19 counties in northwest Missouri. Since that time the University has evolved into a comprehensive, coeducational, state-assisted, regional university. Northwest's primary focus is undergraduate education that includes 42-hours of general education plus a major and minor. The University offers 103 undergraduate majors, 36 master's programs, 3 specialist degrees and a cooperative doctorate in Educational Leadership. Business, Education, Geography and Agriculture graduate the largest number of students each year. Three baccalaureate degree programs (Business Management, Accounting and Computer Science) and two master's programs (Geographic Information Systems and Education) are available over the web. The BA programs also are delivered through 2+2 agreements with 22 community colleges. A number of undergraduate and graduate courses and programs are offered at off-campus sites in classroom settings or through interactive video.\n\r\nNorthwest is a national leader in utilizing technology to deliver, improve and accelerate learning. In addition to completely asynchronous on-line courses, approximately 40% of regular courses are \"web-enhanced.\" Over 80 of the University's major classrooms are \"electronic\"; that is, equipped with projectors, ports to the Internet, document cameras and a VCR or videodisc player. Through the Center for Information Technology in Education (CITE) assistance is provided to faculty as they integrate technology into their courses. These services help provide learning at times and places that are convenient for students.\r\n\r\nNorthwest's \"Culture of Quality\" program was launched in 1987 and has undergone several cycles of evaluation and renewal. The University's longtime commitment to continuous improvement is reflected in our Mission, Vision and Cultural Core Values, outcome-driven Seven-Step Planning Process (SSPP), and continued participation in Baldrige-based self-assessment programs.\n\nNorthwest won the Missouri Quality Award in 1997 and 2001 and was the only higher education institution to be site-visited for the 2003 Baldrige Award.\r\n\r\nNorthwest has the lowest percentage of part-time faculty (2.3 percent) of the 41 institutions in its peer group. \r\n\r\nNorthwest installed the nation's first comprehensive Electronic Campus in 1987. Today the system includes University-provided networked personal computers (PCs) in every student residence hall room and faculty/ administrative office. \r\n\r\nSeveral distinguishing features have contributed to Northwest's competitive success: (1) the Electronic Campus, (2) a reputation as a friendly, relatively small, unusually attractive and well-maintained campus, (3) quality programs and services, (4) moderate tuition rates, and (5) agility in responding to changes in our marketplace. Our success in meeting and exceeding student expectations is reflected in the fact that we have the highest freshman success rate for moderately selective institutions in the state. We have systematically built and continue to maintain these advantages through our planning processes.\r\n\r\nCultural Core Values\n?\tWe focus on our students and stakeholders.\n?\tWe care about each other.\n?\tWe are a learning organization, continually improving our University and ourselves.\n?\tWe collaborate and work together to accomplish our goals.\n?\tWe master the details of what we do.\n?\tWe are open and ethical.\n?\tWe are leaders in our field."

            "Academics\r\nSince 1934, Northwest University has successfully prepared students for service and leadership. More than 1,300 students study in over 50 academic programs including church ministries, teacher education, business, psychology, biblical literature, biology/pre-med, and nursing. In addition, the university offers ten graduate programs: Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Arts in Social Entrepreneurship, Master of Arts in Theology and Culture, Master of Arts in Missional Leadership, Master in Ministry, Master of Education, Master in Teaching, Master of Arts in Counseling Psychology, Master of Arts in International Care and Community Development, and a Doctor of Psychology in Counseling Psychology.\r\n\r\nVision: Carry the Call\r\nStudents at Northwest University are challenged, and then equipped, to \"Carry the Call.\" With their hearts, to develop compassion and character. With their heads, to discover the joy of rigorous study and mental discipline. And with their hands, to actively engage the world around them.\r\n\r\nSpiritual Growth\r\nNorthwest University is committed to the spiritual development of each of its students. The university community gathers three times a week in Butterfield Chapel for worship and preaching by a variety of significant speakers. Students can participate in a variety of ministries that reach out to the community through service and prayer.\r\n\r\nCommunity\r\nNorthwest University is located on a 56-acre campus on the eastside of Seattle in Kirkland, near Lake Washington, placing students within minutes of leading corporate headquarters including Microsoft, Starbucks, Amazon.com, and Nordstrom. Greater Seattle has it all, including festivals, museums, parks, lakes, shopping, and major league sports. The Pacific Northwest offers some of the best venues for activities including skiing, hiking, climbing, windsurfing, biking, and canoeing.\r\n\r\nPractical Experience\r\nNorthwest University students benefit from opportunities to gain practical experience, both locally and globally. For example, students have interned at a Seattle television station and Benaroya Hall, home of the Seattle Symphony. Education majors work with qualified teachers while observing and student teaching in local schools, and ministry students intern with experienced pastors in area churches. In addition, senior students in the Mark and Huldah Buntain School of Nursing spend a month in a cross-cultural context, serving in hospitals and clinics in countries such as Taiwan, India, Mexico, and Africa."

            "The Occidental campus is located in the suburban neighborhood of Eagle Rock, 8 miles from downtown Los Angeles. Downtown L.A. is brimming with opportunities for college students: internships, dining, nightlife, and more. Freshmen must live on campus, and they are allowed to have cars. That’s a good thing, because the campus is within an hour’s drive of big-time attractions like Venice Beach, Disneyland, and Sunset Strip in Hollywood. Parking on campus is free with a permit, and about two-thirds of students bring cars. Students can choose from more than 100 clubs and organizations to get involved in on campus. Occidental has a handful of  sororities and fraternities, and a coed organization, which draw about 15 percent of students.

            "Located in the state capital of Columbus, The Ohio State University is a sprawling school with seemingly endless opportunities for students to get involved. There are more than 900 clubs and organizations on campus, including about 65 fraternities and sororities. Sports are another big part of campus life, with the Ohio State Buckeyes competing in the NCAA Division I Big Ten Conference. The athletic teams are named after the state tree and cheered on by mascot Brutus Buckeye. The football stadium, which was completed in 1922, is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. All Ohio State freshmen must live in one of the 37 residence halls across campus, unless a student is from Central Ohio and can commute from home. The Ohio State First Year Experience offers freshmen orientation, mentors, and special programming to ease the transition into college. Freshmen can also go on the school’s community service spring break, a trip to Chicago that is only open to first-year students. Local community service opportunities are easy to find through the school’s Pay It Forward program, which includes an online listing of volunteer events. Students can also study abroad in more than 40 countries through Ohio State."

            "Founded in 1842, Ohio Wesleyan is a selective, diverse, national liberal arts university in Delaware, Ohio. Students obtain a wide breadth of knowledge through rigorous study of the arts, humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences. The university offers more than 90 majors, sequences, and courses of study. Honors study offers unusual opportunities to talented students, while all students are encouraged to pursue internships and research. Classes are small, and all full-time tenure track-professors hold a Ph.D. or equivalent.\r\n   Ohio Wesleyan is located on an attractive 200-acre campus, and students come from 47 states and 57 countries. Housing options include six large residence halls; a number of smaller special-interest living units, ranging from the Creative Arts House to the Peace and Justice House; and seven fraternity houses. Sorority houses are nonresidential. Three fully renovated residences will open for upperclass men and women in Fall 2010.\r\n   Students can participate in nearly 100 campus organizations as well as 23 NCAA Division III men's and women's athletic teams, including a newly added women's golf team, which will begin play in 2010-2011. In 2008-2009, OWU won the North Coast Athletic Conference All-Sports Trophy for the third consecutive year and the ninth time overall. Ground was broken for the new Meek Aquatics and Recreation Center, to be opened in Fall 2010.\r\n   Ohio Wesleyan was one of only three colleges in the United States to win the 2009 President's Award for Excellence in General Community Service. The student body donated more than 45,000 hours to local, national, and international service. Ohio Wesleyan's chapter of the Society of Physics Students was selected by the national organization as an \"Outstanding SPS Chapter\"; OWU added a major in planetary science; and a medical science symposium was established; Sagan National Colloquium speakers included Barbara Ehrenreich, (Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America) and Susan Eisenhower, president of the Eisenhower Group.\r\n   Experientially based Sagan Fellows classes have been added to the Colloquium; a new program of competitive grants for students and faculty has resulted in a great variety of research projects. Both of these study-research experiences may involve international travel."

            "At Pacific Union College, our mission is to offer an excellent and distinctive Christian education that prepares our students for productive lives of useful human service and uncompromising integrity. We do this by helping students strive for excellence in all areas of life, including the training of the mind and spirit. In this sense, Pacific Union College offers students a complete, whole-life education. \r\n\r\nOne of our greatest strengths is our commitment to undergraduate education. We are truly a teaching community, and our goal is to provide an exceptional learning environment for our students. This means smaller classes, where professors teach the courses, not graduate assistants, and plenty of opportunities for students to interact with faculty and staff. At PUC, it is common for students to find a worthy mentor in a teacher, residence hall dean, or even the college president. Many professors choose to open up their homes for department dinners, offering students a home-cooked meal. The majority of the faculty and staff also attend the college church, where they worship side by side with students.  We believe that authentic relationships between college staff and students are integral to the educational experience. \r\n\r\nAcademically, PUC has received numerous accolades. Along with consistently high ratings from the U.S.News & World Report's \"America's Best Colleges\", PUC's students score above the 90th percentile in several Major Field Achievement Tests. We offer excellent pre-professional programs, and many of our students are accepted into the nation's most prestigious graduate, law, medical, and dental programs.  The Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) has given PUC its most favorable rating. \r\n\r\nAs a Christian organization, we have a commitment to provide an environment where faith can thrive. We encourage our students to thoughtfully examine their personal faith in the classrooms, residence halls, and worship programs. Honest and intellectual exploration of ideas is central to the faith journey at PUC. More than 125 years ago, one of our college's founders expressed hope that Pacific Union College would become a place for \"thinkers, not mere reflectors of other men's thoughts\". While such an ideal is difficult to achieve, it is, we believe, a noble ideal, worthy of pursuit."

The school upholds the New Testament-based traditions of the Churches of Christ. Students must attend 14 spiritual events a semester and take at least three Bible courses during their time at Pepperdine. There is a Church of Christ on campus, as well as a handful of student-led ministries. Outside of church, the school’s sports teams, the Pepperdine Waves, compete in the Division I West Coast Conference. Students can also play club sports, such as lacrosse and a triathlon group, and a variety of intramural sports, from dodgeball to beach volleyball. Freshmen and sophomores must live in university housing on the dry campus, and student spiritual life leaders live in each residence hall. About 25 percent of students are active in the school’s seven sororities and five fraternities, though there is no official Greek housing on campus."

Through the holistic development of the students, they are able to reach their potential as human beings and as contributing members of society. The mission of Philander Smith College is to grant access to higher education to individuals who are, or who have the potential to be, academically talented, regardless of their social, economic, or educational background. The College fosters a love of learning, spirit of independent inquiry, free exchange of ideas, broad and active spiritual life, and concern for the world at large.  Philander Smith College is proud of its legacy as a Historically Black College. While we remain true to our mission of educating deserving students from within the African American community as one of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), we are boldly embracing diversity to provide a real world learning experience for our students. Our campus is rich with diverse cultures, while our student body is 90 percent African American, students representing 18 countries throughout the world are enrolled at PSC.  Neatly nestled on 25 acres in walking distance of downtown Little Rock, Philander Smith offers state-of-the art facilities near the heart of Arkansas' economic, cultural, and governmental centers. New additions to the campus include the Donald W. Reynolds Library and Technology Center, Harry R. Kendall Science and Health Mission Center, Sherman Tate Student Recreation Center, and a new student residential life center. \"Students have a new place to live and learn at the Great Philander Smith College.\""

            ". Students can major in an academic program at any of the five institutions, or can design a major at Pitzer. All campuses are within walking distance of each other in Claremont, Calif., and Pitzer students can take up to half their courses at other schools. If a student doesn’t feel like walking, they can take a free bicycle through Pitzer’s Green Bike Program. The campuses’ close proximities are ideal for Pitzer student athletes, who team up with peers at Pomona College for varsity sports. The Pomona-Pitzer Sagehens compete in the Division III Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, cheered on by mascot Cecil, a costumed blue bird. Unlike most institutions, Pitzer does not require students to submit SAT or ACT scores as part of their application, as long as a student is in the top 10 percent of their high school class or has a 3.5 or greater GPA. There are more than 100 student clubs and organizations, but there is no Greek system. All full-time students must live on campus, unless they have received school permission to move off. With so many institutions in Claremont, Pitzer students live among 5,000 students in the suburban area. Los Angeles is 35 miles away, and students with cars can get to Santa Monica Beach, the Mojave Desert, and Hollywood in an hour."

We strive for excellence both in the classroom as an institution of inquiry and dialogue in our undergraduate College of Arts and Sciences and on the playing field as a new NCAA Division I school and member of the Big South Conference. The new Presbyterian College School of Pharmacy will open in the fall of 2010, and PC was honored to open a Confucius Institute in the fall of 2009, the only undergraduate liberal arts college in the country awarded one from the Chinese government.  Ample opportunities exist for study abroad, internships, and faculty/student research. PC was named a Distinguished member of the National Presidents Honor Roll of Service in both 2007 and 2008. A student body that engages service projects in the city of Clinton and Upstate South Carolina lives the College's motto, \"Dum Vivimus Servimus\" or \"While we live, we serve,\" eventually becoming an alumni body that serves in communities throughout the world. Seven Presbyterian College professors have been named South Carolina CASE (Council for the Advancement and Support of Education) professors of the year, twice as many as any other institution in SC.  Presbyterian College students and faculty note that relationships set PC apart from other institutions, as faculty engage students both in and out of the classroom. As a liberal arts college that embraces honor, academic rigor, and community relationships, we are also a church-related liberal arts college, whose  philosophy of excellence in reason and excellence in faith allows us to examine and celebrate our Christian faith in the context of the global community."

            "Founded in 1860 by Franciscan friars, Quincy University is a Catholic, co-educational, residential university offering undergraduate, graduate, and adult education programs that integrate liberal arts, active learning, practical experience, and Franciscan values. Known as a caring and engaged learning community, Quincy embraces its Franciscan heritage while promoting the values of inclusion, nonviolence, reverence for creation, and celebration. Students of all faiths and beliefs are welcomed and encouraged to grow personally and serve others. In addition, approximately 98 percent of students from all family income levels receive need or merit-based financial aid. Nestled within Quincy, Ill., a city situated on limestone bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River, Quincy's campus offers a combination of simplistic living, modern technology, and natural beauty. Francis Hall, the main academic building, features classic architectural elements with a Tower. An adjoining building houses the Main Chapel designed in Romanesque-style and 2 smaller chapels. The campus is green in the summertime and bursting with color in the fall and spring. Every resident room is equipped with high-speed Internet access and students have access to 6 computer labs plus campus-wide Wireless Internet. More than 1,500 students from 27 states and 9 other countries enroll in over 30 undergraduate majors and 4 graduate programs. Students gain insight not just from their major but from many fields of study, helping them to think critically and see issues from different points of view. Learning is grounded in the real world, taught by faculty members who are leaders in their fields and supplemented by significant internships in the workplace. For instance, nursing students practice procedures in a simulated hospital lab, prior to their clinical work; freshman aviation students fly in the air after attending school for just 2 weeks; and courses for education majors are held at area elementary and high schools. Class sizes average 20 students, where professors not only know students' names, they care about students' intellectual and personal growth. Our Learning Communities give students in like majors an opportunity to live and learn together by enrolling in similar courses and creating study groups in residence halls. Students in Learning Communities develop their QU-family support system immediately and become more involved on campus. Internships are integral to a Quincy education. Students intern as early as their first year gaining valuable work experience. Organizations and businesses that hire Quincy students include ESPN, Walt Disney World, St. Louis Cardinals, Archer Daniels Midland, and the National Association of Broadcasters. Our worldwide service projects teach students about society, about what it means to be compassionate, and about their values, not to mention skills in team building, organizing, and leading. Our alumni, in all 50 states and 12 countries, are eager to help new students and graduates succeed. Recent grads include a New York environmental analyst, a St. Louis Cardinals pitcher, an RN at Mayo Clinic, and a senior national accounts manager at USA Today. Graduate, law, and medical schools attended by recent grads include Carnegie Mellon, Washington University School of Law, Loyola, and the Adler School of Professional Psychology. Student-athletes compete at the NCAA Division II level in 16 sports, where academic success is emphasized along with athletic achievement. Students choose from more than 40 clubs and organizations, including student newspaper, performing arts, 3 national Greek organizations, and professional organizations. Our intramural program and state-of-the-art Health and Fitness Center are also popular. Quincy University is about learning, caring and connecting. It's about living your education. Individual visits can be scheduled weekdays and Saturdays, and we also host group visits throughout the year."

            "Ramapo College of New Jersey is sometimes mistaken for a private college.  This is, in part, due to its unique interdisciplinary academic structure, its size of almost 6,000 students, and its pastoral setting.  Ramapo offers bachelor's degrees in the arts, business, humanities, social sciences and the sciences, master's degrees in nursing, educational technology and liberal arts, as well as professional studies including teacher certification and social work. Ramapo has articulation programs at the bachelor's, master's and doctoral levels in the health and medical fields. Ramapo offers these joint programs in partnership with the University of Medicine and Dentistry (UMDNJ), New York Chiropractic College, the State University of New York (SUNY), New York University College of Dentistry, and New York College of Podiatric Medicine. \r\nIn Fall 2007, Ramapo concluded our joint Nursing degree program with UMDNJ, and transitioned the curriculum for BSN and MSN studies totally over to Ramapo College. Ramapo boasts an average student faculty ratio of 18 to 1.  The average class size of 23 affords students the opportunity to develop close ties to Ramapo's exceptional faculty, of whom more than 95 percent hold terminal degrees in their field."

            "Randolph College builds on a long history of academic excellence, intellectual inquiry and artistic expression, fostered by close student/faculty relationships, a spirit of exploration and collaboration, and exposure to a rich diversity of people and ideas. Honoring its founding as Randolph-Macon Woman's College, the College both promotes understanding in its students of how gender shapes the lives of women and men and empowers its graduates to live and foster \"A Life More Abundant\". Randolph College education values personal challenge, global perspective, and applied experience, as defined by:\r\n\r\nAn Honors environment, where each student can contribute to the intellectual life of the community and confront important questions by working closely with faculty members to take responsibility for the student's own learning, bring fresh perspectives to the classroom and undertake original research or engage in artistic creation in a capstone experience.\r\n\r\nA Global environment, where each student can connect to the world and seek to understand the important issues of the 21st century through study abroad, foreign language and culture offerings, courses with global and historical perspectives, interaction with international students, and participation in off-campus experiences.\r\n\r\nAn Experiential Learning environment, where each student can collaborate with those in the campus community, the nation and beyond and actively explore the student's interests in imaginative ways through a broad range of hands-on courses, co-curricular and athletic activities, leadership development opportunities, volunteer service, internships and study abroad. \r\n\r\nThese core characteristics stimulate students to pursue and achieve goals that have personal meaning in an atmosphere of integrity and mutual trust, owing to the Honor System that has long been a key element of the College's culture.\r\n\r\nThe Randolph student body is richly diverse, drawn from approximately 40 states and 40 foreign countries. The population is 67 percent white, 21 percent domestic students of color, and 12 percent international. Students are forward thinking. Only about 15 percent think their highest educational attainment will be a bachelor's degree. 60 percent anticipate earning a master's degree or Ph.D. and 25 percent expect to earn a professional degree such as a J.D., M.D., or M.B.A. \r\n\r\nThe College is looking for students who are excited about engaging in the educational process in its many dimensions -- academic, co-curricular, and social. It encourages students to be open to new ideas and to explore issues and problems that fascinate them."

            "Founded in 1830, Randolph-Macon is a selective, co-educational liberal arts college ideally located in scenic Ashland, Virginia, just minutes north of Richmond, the state capital and 90 miles south of Washington D.C.  The college is easily accessible from any direction, sits off of Interstate 95, has an Amtrak station across from campus and is in close proximity to Richmond International Airport. Randolph-Macon has an enrollment of approximately 1200 students and achieves its mission of developing the minds and character of its students by maintaining a student-faculty ration of 11:1 and an average class size of 15. The college offers a vast choice of majors and minors, has an outstanding national reputation for its exceptional faculty and rigorous academic program, and prepares students for graduate school and a lifetime of changing careers and success in the real world. The foundation of Randolph-Macon's strength is the quality of its faculty.  Approximately 90% of all faculty have their Ph.D.s and are recognized nationally for teaching excellence and highly-regarded as experts in their area.  The personal interaction between R-MC's faculty and students create unique moments of connection that both challenge students to maximize their potential and help build relationships that last a lifetime. Randolph-Macon offers a wide breadth of local, national and international internships in virtually every field. Students are able to experience a meaningful educational experience in various careers in a real work environment and demonstrate their potential. Randolph-Macon also has an active alumni body who are engaged in the life of the college.  They provide students with valuable networking opportunities, both while at R-MC and after graduation. Randolph-Macon's extensive international education program provides students with various global opportunities. Students can study abroad for a semester or immerse themselves in another culture for one month during the college's unique January term (J-term) program.  Over 200 students (80-90% of the graduating class) travel to other countries each year with faculty members to each continent.  During J-term, many students track their adventures by submitting J-Term Diaries or blogs that allows the reader to follow their month-long journeys and new areas of discovery.  This program also affords students with the opportunity to participate in an internship or other area of study on campus. The Schapiro Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program supports more than 30 students each summer, allowing for equipment purchase, on-campus housing and stipend payment, to work one-on-one with faculty members on research projects in the sciences, social sciences and humanities. Students conduct research in a variety of areas and are provided the opportunity to share their findings with their peers and at regional, national and international conferences with their faculty. A Randolph-Macon education is also affordable.  The college offers a competitive financial aid program to include scholarships and grants; a significant percentage of applicants are eligible to receive some form of financial assistance.  Randolph-Macon is a proud member of NCAA Division III, the Old Dominion Athletic Conference and sponsors 15 intercollegiate sports.  Many of its teams and students are nationally-ranked and have won national championships.  The college also offers a healthy Greek Life system and provides dozens of student organizations from which to choose.  A majority of students are actively engaged and participate in community service and outreach programs and have raised thousands of dollars for community organizations. Randolph-Macon College's Phi Beta Kappa Chapter received the organization's Triennial award for the most outstanding chapter at a liberal arts college in the United States. Randolph-Macon is also the oldest United Methodist Church-affiliated college in the nation."

            "At Reed College, a small liberal arts institution in Portland, Ore., students won’t find a few traditional college staples: Greek organizations, varsity sports, or course grades. Instead, students—or Reedies, as they’re called—can select from about 150 other student organizations and can compete on intramural and club sports teams. Professors assign a letter grade for coursework, but students will only be informed of the grade if it is below a C. There is no dean’s list or honor roll because the school evaluates students on a pass or no-pass scale. Out of classes, which tend to be rigorous, there are celebrations throughout each semester to keep students entertained. In the fall, students gather for the Halloween Harvest Ball, among other formal dances, and the campus celebrates the end of classes each spring with the weekend-long Renn Fayre Festival. Freshmen do not have to live on campus, but they are guaranteed a dorm room. Portland, a city of more than 1 million people, is about a 15-minute bus ride away. To enjoy Oregon’s outdoors, students can join in on planned Outing Club trips or organize their own. Skiers and snowboarders may want to take advantage of the Reed ski cabin, a lodge in Mount Hood where students, alumni, and faculty can stay. The ski cabin is less than 90 minutes from campus by car. Water sports fans can also find surfing and sea kayaking options in the Pacific Ocean about 90 minutes from campus."

            "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute was founded on the principles of bringing science to everyday life, and that ethos is still prevalent today. About a quarter of students are involved in Greek L.I.F.E., as the fraternity and sorority scene is known at the school, which stresses Leadership, Innovation, Fortitude, and Evolution. More students—about three fourths—play sports at the varsity, club, or intramural level. True to the school’s mission, the varsity athletes are known as the Engineers, and compete in the Eastern College Athletic Conference. There are also more than 175 student organizations. Freshmen must live on campus, usually in dormitories that only house first-year students. RPI’s campus, in Troy, N.Y., is nestled in an ideal location for nature lovers. The school overlooks the Hudson River, where waterfront activities abound, and is close to Grafton Lakes State Park, Lake George, and the Adirondack Mountains. For an urban experience, Albany is 9 miles away."

Located outside of Memphis, Tenn., the Rhodes campus is close to a multitude of internship opportunities at powerhouse institutions, including St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and nine Fortune 500 companies. For fun, students can venture into downtown Memphis to experience the city’s famed music scene, dining, professional sporting events, and museums. Freshmen and sophomores must live on campus, which puts them close to annual school events like the weekend-long music festival called Rites of Spring. Greek life is a huge outlet at Rhodes, as nearly half of all students are involved in the school’s 15 or so fraternities and sororities. There are about 80 other student organizations to check out, too. About 25 percent of students play on the varsity Lynx sports teams, which compete in the NCAA Division III Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference. More students—about 65 percent—will spend at least one semester off campus, studying in a foreign country or at",

            "Roanoke College gives students valuable depth and breadth in their education.  The depth comes from intensive learning through strong majors and independent studies, special research opportunities, internships and other forms of experiential learning.  The breadth comes from a series of unique core courses that span the four years of the undergraduate experience.  At Roanoke College, students learn from professors who are experts in their fields.  Ninety-five percent of the college's tenure-track faculty members have the highest degrees possible.  Almost all professors practice what they teach or contribute to scholarly works in their academic areas or do both.  Because of this close-knit academic environment, students learn directly through the experiences of these experts.  The type of mentoring relationship that many students have with their Roanoke professors leads them to excellent graduate school placement or directly into fulfilling careers.  In fact, almost all seniors (about 95 percent) receive job offers within six months of graduation or go on to graduate school.  While at Roanoke College, students also benefit from many opportunities to get involved as leaders or participants in the college's 100+ clubs and organizations.  With half of its students from Virginia and half from out of state, the college offers regional and national exposure.  Alumni have attended a fine selection of graduate schools such as Johns Hopkins, Duke, Columbia, University of Pennsylvania, and Yale.  In addition, two recent Roanoke alumni were inducted into the national medical school honor society at the University of Virginia.  Graduates also have gone on to fascinating careers ranging from scientific research, underwater archaeology and medicine to television production, humanitarianism and government as well as starting their own businesses.  Yet at the heart of all who pass through the college's doors is an overwhelming desire to pursue the things they love."

            "Rockford College's mission is to educate men and women to lead responsible productive lives by means of a curriculum grounded in liberal arts learning and complemented and extended by professional and practical experiences.  Through the total academic and co-curricular experience, Rockford College strives to prepare students for fulfilling lives, careers, and participation in a modern and changing global society.\r\n\r\nAt Rockford College we have a vision to be Jane Addams' college in the 21st century. By that, we signal an aspiration to live, learn and work in a contemporary way that honors the principles of Jane Addams, the distinguished 1881 graduate of the college who founded Hull House in Chicago and became the first American woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.\r\n\r\nLong before Miss Addams won the 1931 Nobel Peace Prize, she was a Rockford College student. Today, we are still educating students like Jane, activists, intellectuals, humanitarians, and peacemakers. Our liberal arts program is designed for those rare individuals who have a vision for changing the world, who care about social action and public service. We are looking for students who share our passion for social justice and civic engagement. At Rockford, our students are not preparing to make a difference in the world. They are making a difference now. Rockford College offers: accredited university-level courses, fewer than 20 students per class, state-of-the-art wireless Internet, more than 70 majors, minors and concentrations, easy access to Chicago, on-campus housing and food service. \r\n\r\nRockford College has a rich history of encouraging students to become engaged and active citizens in our community. Students who join Rockford College become part of a 162 year tradition and they use their time here to take part in the myriad opportunities that will come their way, on campus and off. Whether it is in a classroom, on an athletic team, in our theater, as a volunteer for a community service project or through experiences studying abroad, we hope that our students' time at Rockford College is memorable and meaningful.\r\n\r\nStudents at Rockford College today, like Jane Addams before them, think critically, act compassionately, and embrace the ideals of citizenship. If you share our commitment to critical thinking and compassionate action, we invite you to join us."

            "Roosevelt University was founded in 1945 and named in honor of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt.  From its beginning, Roosevelt pioneered the concept of making higher education available to all students who could qualify academically regardless of their social or economic class, racial or ethnic origin, sex, or age.  This ideal attracted Albert Einstein, Albert Schweitzer, Eleanor Roosevelt, Marian Anderson, and Pearl Buck to the University's first advisory board. Today, Roosevelt remains dedicated to the enlightenment of the human spirit through educating socially conscious citizens for active and dedicated lives as leaders in their professions and their communities."

Today Sage continues to encourage women to take risks, discover their strengths, and apply what they've learned in the real world. \r\nSage remains one of the few women's colleges in the country that has a general education core based on women's experiences; first-year students take \"Women in the World\" and seniors take \"Women Changing the World,\" reflecting their progress toward embodying the RSC motto, \"To Be, To Know, To Do.\"  Sage's Early College program is one of the only two in the country designed for early college entry by outstanding your women in high school. \r\nSage is proud to offer women the opportunity to excel in areas such as math and science, where they have traditionally been excluded.  The College maintains the only nanotechnology business incubator on a women's college campus in the U.S. The $5 million Incubator for Nanotechnology Ventures, Emerging Sciences, and Technologies (INVEST at Sage) is a nanotechnology incubator created in 2005 by Russell Sage College and Evident Technologies of Troy.  The incubator provides space and resources to help high tech companies grow and expand, while advancing Sage's programs in science, technology and business. \r\nRussell Sage is also home to the New York State Theatre Institute, a professional company that produces theatre for family audiences.  All theatre and musical theatre majors intern with NYSTI, where they have the opportunity to qualify for membership in the Actors' Equity Association.  \r\nUndergraduate research is a hallmark of RSC, which sends students annually to the National Conference on Undergraduate Research and funds individual students whose presentations have been accepted at national and regional conferences.  All majors have a capstone research or performance experience required of seniors, and each year the College celebrates student accomplishment at the Spring Symposium of Works in Progress.  The new Donnelly Center for Undergraduate Research assists students with research and presentation skills.\r\nAlso new at RSC is the Sage Language Acquisition Program (SLAP), which adds Italian and Chinese to the current offerings of Spanish and French.  SLAP features innovative teaching methods that focus on oral comprehension and fluency as well as the cultural context of language.  SLAP students live in International House-one of several Living/Learning opportunities at the College.\r\nFinally, many Russell Sage students elect to accelerate into masters or doctoral programs at Sage.  By using summers to complete some degree requirements, students in any major my complete their undergraduate work in three to three and a half years, and move directly into a graduate program in Business, Education, Psychology, Occupational Therapy, or Physical Therapy.  Accelerated programs are also available in conjunction with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (math/engineering), Albany Law School (3+3 BA/JD), and Albany Medical Center (early assurance Medical School program, articulation agreement with Physician's Assistant Program).  New in Fall 2009 is the Renaissance Baccalaureate, a three-year accelerated degree offered in a number of multi-disciplinary majors (Environmental Studies, International and Globalization Studies, American Studies among them), which features a 15-credit interdisciplinary summer course called Sage on the Hudson."

            "Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, embodies the historical development of higher education in the United States. From its colonial inception as Queen's College in 1766, the institution grew to become Rutgers College in 1825. In 1864 it was designated the state's land-grant institution. Assuming university status in 1924, it was further transformed by legislative acts in 1945, and in 1956 the institution became Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey. 1989 marked another historic milestone when the university became a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU), connoting its position as one of the major public comprehensive research universities in the U.S., and the only one of its kind in New Jersey. Rutgers' evolution is not yet complete. Strategic goals for Rutgers University established by university president Richard L. McCormick and the Board of Governors in 2004 are intended to provide a pathway for achieving two overarching aspirations for the university -- greater academic distinction and more significant service to communities beyond campus, particularly to the citizens of our state. In carrying out its threefold mission of instruction, research and public service, Rutgers strives to uphold the following principles. (See also Appendix A, Mission Statement). To conduct fundamental and applied research, to train scholars, researchers and professionals, and to make knowledge available to students, scholars and the general public. To maintain its traditional strength in the arts and sciences, while simultaneously developing such new professional and career-oriented programs as are warranted by public interest, social need, and employment opportunities. To make its educational programs accessible to an appropriately broad student body. To extend its resources and knowledge to various sectors of the public, and to bring its special expertise to bear on the solution of public problems. In fulfilling its mission of service to the state of New Jersey, Rutgers maintains three main campuses in strategic regions of the state: Camden, Newark, and New Brunswick. In addition, through the extension agents of its agricultural experiment station, Rutgers has a presence in all 21 counties of New Jersey."

            "For high school students who can’t decide what their ideal college campus would look like, Rutgers University may be the solution. The flagship campus of New Jersey’s state university, based in New Brunswick, , is actually split into five mini-campuses known as Douglass, Cook, College Avenue, Busch, and Livingston. Each campus has a unique setting and identity, from the hip student feel of the College Avenue campus to the farmland and science buildings at Cook Campus. Each mini-campus has its own student center and dining options. Freshmen do not have to live on campus, but those who choose to do so have options on each campus, too. There are more than 700 student clubs and organizations across the mini-campuses, including about 70 fraternities and sororities. The Rutgers Scarlet Knights compete in the NCAA Division I Big East Conference. The university also has a virtual campus on Second Life."

            "For more than a century, San Diego State University has been providing undergraduate and graduate students with a well-balanced, high quality education.  Now with an enrollment of more than 34,000 students, SDSU is the largest institution of higher education in the San Diego region and one of the largest in California.  It has also become one of the most popular among new undergraduates, receiving more than 62,000 applications for the fall 2008 academic year.  \r\n\r\nRenowned for its academic excellence, the university is home to top-ranking programs in education, international business, entrepreneurship, social work, biology and many more.  Currently, ten graduate programs are ranked in the top 50 in their categories by U.S. News and World Report's \"America's Best Graduate Schools.\"  San Diego State students can choose from 81 undergraduate majors, 64 master's programs and 16 doctoral degree programs in areas ranging from construction engineering to journalism and media studies.  \r\n\r\nLocated just miles from the Pacific Ocean and less than an hour from the U.S.-Mexico border, San Diego State students are extending their educational experiences well beyond the borders of the campus.  In fact, SDSU ranks No. 1 in California and No. 2 in the nation for sending students abroad as part of their college experience. More than 1,400 SDSU students studied abroad last year, traveling to places like China, India and Japan.  In addition, the university has pioneered several dual and triple degree programs which allow students to earn degrees from universities worldwide in addition to SDSU. \r\n\r\nIncreasingly recognized for innovative research, San Diego State has achieved the prestigious designation of Research University with high research activity granted by the Carnegie Foundation. SDSU has been ranked as the #1 small research university in the country for two years in a row by Academic Analytics.  Since 2000, SDSU faculty and staff have attracted more than $1 billion in grants and contracts for research and program administration.  \r\n\r\nPrivate giving to San Diego State has also risen sharply in recent years, reaching a record $65 million in the 2003-2004 fiscal year.  During 2007, SDSU launched its first comprehensive fundraising campaign with the goal of becoming a top-10 urban research university in the next decade. \r\n\r\nSDSU faculty are committed to the teacher-scholar model, contributing unique and model research that benefits the world-at-large while giving undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to have hands-on research experience. Students participate in an academic curriculum distinguished by direct contact with faculty and an increasing international emphasis that prepares them for a global future.\r\n\r\nSDSU,  its  students  and  alumni  serve  as  a  key  engine  for  the  San  Diego  regional economy, producing thousands  of  graduates  each  year,  60%  of  whom  stay  in  San  Diego to pursue their  careers. \r\n\r\nA strong community partner, SDSU is committed to serving the richly diverse San Diego region.  The university leads programs focused on advancing urban education, improving local water quality and enriching cross-border relationships with Mexico.  \r\n\r\nSDSU's beautiful and historic campus serves to enrich the student experience, providing leading-edge laboratories and high-tech classrooms within its Spanish-style architecture.  Thousands of students live on campus and many more participate in campus life through the hundreds of academic, athletic and Greek organizations."

            "Founded in 1923, Schreiner University is a private liberal arts university nestled in the beautiful Texas Hill Country in Kerrville, a 60-minute drive from San Antonio.\r\nPrimarily undergraduate, Schreiner offers a personalized, integrated education that prepares its students for meaningful work and purposeful lives in a changing global society. \r\nA supportive university community is a tradition at Schreiner, with professors who excel in the art of teaching, a shared commitment to each student???s success, and a campus life that builds lifelong friendships.\r\nOne measure of educational value is the amount of personal attention students receive from their professors, and they???re getting their money???s worth at Schreiner. While enrollment has grown to 1,011, the student-teacher ratio is kept at 13:1. All classes are small and most have fewer than 20 students. And there are no teaching assistants at Schreiner???all classes are taught by experienced and fully qualified faculty.\r\nSchreiner awards baccalaureate degrees, as well as two master???s degrees, and offers 27 undergraduate majors and programs of study: accounting, biochemistry, biology, business, chemistry, communication studies, creative arts, education, engineering 3/2, English, exercise science, finance, general studies, graphic design, history, humanities, international business, management, management information systems, marketing, mathematics, music, political science, psychology, religion, sport management and theatre, in addition to pre-dentistry, pre-law, pre-medicine, pre-optometry, pre-pharmacy, pre-seminary and pre-veterinary science programs. \r\nSchreiner???s graduate programs include: Master of Education, Master of Education in Teaching, and Principal Certification. Schreiner???s Master of Education and Master of Education in Teaching degrees are distinctive in that its students graduate in only one year attending class on campus one Saturday per month and participate in online instruction. No night classes. No weekday classes.\r\nSchreiner takes prides in being accessible to most students, even those whose families??? financial resources are very limited. Ninety-eight percent of Schreiner???s freshmen have received some form of financial aid and the average financial aid package for full-time undergraduates is more than $12,000. Of those, many received 100 percent of their Schreiner tuition. Most find the actual cost of a Schreiner education very close to what they would pay at a Texas public 4-year school.\r\nSchreiner also offers a rich campus life with more than 40 student organizations that encourage students to develop leadership skills and to apply classroom knowledge to real life challenges. \r\nRelated by covenant to the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Schreiner welcomes students of all faiths. Schreiner???s vibrant Campus Ministry program supports a variety of faith- and denomination-based student groups.\r\nOne in three Schreiner undergraduates participates in intercollegiate athletics, competing in Division III NCAA American Southwest Conference sports: basketball, baseball, soccer, tennis, softball, golf, volleyball and cross-country.\r\nWithin the last decade, Schreiner has spent nearly $40 million building and upgrading facilities and offers state-of-the-art technology in every field of study. Last year, SU completed ???The Oaks,??? a new student residence complex. Mountaineer Fitness Center opened Spring 2009. This fall, freshmen will move into brand-new Faulkner Residence Hall. \r\nAt Schreiner University, ???Learning by Heart??? is more than an expression; it embodies the experience of learning with your whole being.\r\nVisit www.schreiner.edu for more information about Schreiner University.

            "Since 1856, Seton Hall University has been a catalyst for leadership, developing the whole student, in mind, heart and spirit. Seton Hall combines the resources of a large university with the personal attention of a small liberal arts college. Its attractive suburban campus is only 14 miles outside of New York City, with the wealth of employment, internship, cultural and entertainment opportunities the city offers. Seton Hall students - who hail from all 50 states and 67 countries - choose from a wide range of majors, including communication, business, diplomacy, nursing and education. Seton Hall's emphasis on academic excellence has led to a marked increase in the number of students and professors chosen for prestigious academic awards. In 2008, Annick Routhier-Labadie '08 became the University's first Rhodes Scholar. The number of students chosen for the Fulbright international educational exchange program has doubled, and recently the Harry S. Truman Scholarship Committee for the first time selected multiple Seton Hall students as finalists. In 2009 alone, five faculty members were selected to travel overseas on Fulbright grants. Their projects ranged from teaching documentary filmmaking in Jordan to leading interfaith dialogues in Slovenia. In 2010, Business Week ranked Seton Hall's undergraduate business as eighth best in return on investment for private universities across the country. As the nation's oldest diocesan Catholic university, Seton Hall embraces students of all races and religions, challenging each to better the world with integrity, compassion and a commitment to serving others."

            "Among its many unique traditions, one that most distinguishes Sewanee students is their clothing. Unlike most other schools, wearing pajama-like clothing or jeans is not a rite of college passage at the southern Tennessee college of Sewanee—University of the South. In fact, it’s not even allowed. Sewanee students dress up for every class, a tradition meant to honor the sanctity of education. After class, students may need to change clothes if they want to explore all of the campus’ surrounding wilderness. Known as the Domain, the southern Tennessee campus has nearby opportunities to rock climb, mountain bike, and cave. More than 95 percent of all students live on campus, and freshmen are required to live on campus. The campus is also home to about 100 student clubs and organizations, including more than 20 very popular fraternities and sororities. The Sewanee Tigers compete in the NCAA Division III Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference. The football team plays on the oldest field in the South. Sewanee has 36 majors, and writing as a skill is stressed in all of them. Each summer, the school hosts the Sewanee Writers’ Conference, a congregation of esteemed authors and journalists. Nearly half the student body studies abroad doing their college tenure, and, for shorter trips within Tennessee, the campus is a 45-minute drive from Chattanooga and 90 minutes from Nashville."

            "Freshmen are immediately integrated into school culture at Skidmore College. Through the First Year Experience Program, freshmen are paired up with peer mentors and placed in introductory Scribner Seminars. Freshmen must live on campus in dorms near other students in their seminar. About 40 adventurous freshman can spend the fall semester in London, part of the First Year Experience program that lets students kick off their college career across the Atlantic. Back at the school’s campus in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., there are close to 100 student clubs and organizations, but no Greek system. Students can eat in traditional dining halls or, if they’re especially ambitious, can cook their own meals in an on-campus kitchen. There are about 70 majors at Skidmore, and students can design their own academic programs, too. All students, regardless of major, will take science and mathematics courses. Outside the classroom, the school sports teams are known as the Thoroughbreds and compete in the NCAA Division III Liberty League. For fun off campus, downtown Saratoga Springs is a mile away. Students can check out horse races at the Saratoga Race Course or tour the historic Saratoga Battlefield. The nearby Adirondack Mountains offer opportunities to ski, snowboard, mountain bike, and white water raft, and, for a metropolitan experience, New York, Boston, and Montreal are each about a three-hour drive away."

            "Sonoma State University is a relatively small (8,500 students), residential, public university committed to student retention, graduation and satisfaction. As California's premier public undergraduate institution, SSU has a commitment to graduating students who have the ability to think critically and ethically and can effectively use information technology. Its primary mission is to develop and maintain excellent programs of undergraduate instruction grounded in the liberal arts and sciences. Instructional programs are designed to challenge students not only to acquire knowledge but also to develop the skills of critical analysis, careful reasoning, creativity, and self-expression. SSU offers 41 bachelor's degree programs and 14 master's degree programs. In addition, the University offers a joint master's degree in mathematics with San Francisco State University and a joint doctorate in educational administration with California State University, Sacramento and the University of California, Davis. The University offers nine credential programs and eight undergraduate and graduate certificate programs. The quality of the educational experience at Sonoma State University depends upon close human and intellectual relationships among students and faculty to foster the open exchange of ideas. The university is committed to creating a learning community in which people from diverse backgrounds and cultures are valued for the breadth of their perspectives and are encouraged in their intellectual pursuits. Sonoma's faculty maintain active scholarly lives and the University encourages faculty projects that involve students in research and other creative activities. Currently 2,400 students live on campus and housing for an additional 700 students is underway. The SSU residential community offers a variety of accommodations from shared bedrooms in residential suites to private bedrooms and baths in apartments. SSU's 59,000 square foot sustainable building design recreation center, complete with a climbing wall, received the Outstanding Sports Facilities Award by the National Intramural Recreational Sports Association. Additionally, a renovated 21st century Darwin Hall, the university's science building, has new laboratories and classrooms supporting the needs of modern science curriculum. Currently under construction is the $110 million Donald & Maureen Green Music Center which includes a 1,400 seat world-class concert hall, Schroeder's Recital Hall (named for one of the characters of the famed cartoonist Charles Schulz) and a music education building. The University was gifted the Fairfield Osborne Preserve, located within a mile of campus, which is dedicated to protecting and restoring natural communities and fostering ecological understanding through education and research. Additionally, the University accepted a 3,500 acre wilderness preserve in northern Sonoma County, called the Galbreath Wildlands Preserve to promote environmental education and research, as well as to steward the diverse landscape of the preserve. The Sonoma State University Department of Intercollegiate Athletics sponsors 13 intercollegiate sports, five men's and eight women's: men's baseball, basketball, golf, soccer and tennis; women's basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, volleyball, and water polo. SSU's teams, named the Seawolves, are a member of the NCAA Division II and they compete in the California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA), the premiere intercollegiate athletic association in the country, and have won several national titles."

            "Think of a specialty and chances are good we offer a degree in that subject.  In fact, we offer more than 200 programs for our undergraduates.  Our university consistently receives national recognition for its outstanding programs, whether it is genomic research in soybeans in the College of Agricultural Sciences, with its 2,000-acre farms; advanced friction studies in the College of Engineering; teacher preparation and the School of Social Work in the College of Education and Human Services; or ecology and nanomaterials science in the College of Science.\r\n\r\nOur undergraduates enjoy many research opportunities, which is rare among major universities.  Freshmen participate in our newest research program, called Research Rookies.  Other students are involved in the Research-Enriched Academic Challenge, in which they win grants of up to $1,500 for research projects and work with faculty mentors.  These are just two examples of programs designed to provide our undergraduates with early exposure to the benefits of research.\r\n\r\nOur students distinguish themselves in a variety of pursuits.  For example, speech communication students win national debate championships; students in radio-television capture national student Emmy Awards for an alternative TV news magazine; and our student wind ensemble performs on the national and international stages - Carnegie Hall in 2008 and in China in 2009."

            "Despite its name, this private university in Dallas is a secular institution when it comes to classes. The school was founded by what became the United Methodist Church in 1911, but is now home to students of many religious affiliations. Outdoor activities are plentiful in Dallas, a city that boasts an average of 232 days of sunshine a year. Students can check out the Dallas International Film Festival, which draws 40,000 viewers annually, or explore the more than 400 parks in the city. First-year students must live on SMU’s campus, either exclusively with other freshmen in first-year halls or with a mix of students in four-class halls. The campus is also home to the George W. Bush Presidential Center, which comprises a Bush administration museum, library, and public policy institute, and frequently hosts speakers. The SMU Mustangs sports teams play in the Division I Conference USA, supported by mascot Peruna, a black stallion Shetland pony. About 2,300 students are involved in SMU Greek life, and all students can participate in annual events such as the Festival of Lights, a candlelit assembly on the school’s Main Quad each December, and the Mane Event, a celebration of spring complete with bands and food."

            "At Southern New Hampshire University, we believe there are no limits to what our students can achieve. With a culture that inspires every person, every day, to do more, learn more, try harder and exceed expectations, we are dedicated to helping students realize their potential.\r\n\r\nSNHU offers undergraduate programs in business, culinary arts, education, hospitality management and liberal arts and graduate programs in business, community economic development and education. Programs are offered on campus, online and on location at our centers in New Hampshire and Maine.\r\n\r\nThe university has approximately 1,900 traditional, full-time undergraduate day students, with a total enrollment in all divisions (day, evening, weekend, and online undergraduate and graduate students) of about 9,400. \r\n\r\nThe wireless campus features new dorms and apartment buildings, a simulated stock trading room, multimedia classrooms, the museum-quality McIninch Art Gallery, virtual science labs, a library with resources that can be accessed via the Internet, a fitness center that rivals members-only gyms, athletic fields, cooking labs, a bakery, and a student-run restaurant. \r\n\r\nSNHU is the first carbon-neutral campus in New Hampshire and is a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Green Power Partner. The EPA recently named SNHU a national College & University Green Power Challenge winner.\r\n \r\nA $20-million building project will be completed in 2009 and includes a 33,500-square-foot academic building and a 47,700-square-foot dining hall. Both buildings will reflect the university's commitment to sustainability. Among the environmentally friendly features are low-flow plumbing, automatic fixtures and lighting, and energy-efficient windows and heating and cooling systems.\r\n\r\nThe small-school atmosphere provides students with ample opportunities for participation in class and taking on leadership roles in the campus community. Community is important at SNHU; you'll find our caring and friendly faculty and staff in the gym, in the dining hall and in the stands, not just in their classrooms and offices.\r\n\r\nIntercollegiate teams compete in Division II of the NCAA, the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and the Northeast-10 Conference. Sports include baseball, men's and women's basketball, cheerleading, men's and women's cross-country, golf, ice hockey, men's and women's lacrosse, men's and women's soccer, softball, men's and women's tennis, and volleyball. Our powerful athletic teams dominate on the field and in the classroom. The University's student-athletes earned honors from the NCAA and USA Today for high grades and 100-percent graduation rates.\r\n\r\nThe university is ideally located, with easy access to downtown Manchester, New Hampshire's largest city and the \"most livable\" city in the East, according to Money magazine. Public transportation is available and students may keep cars on campus. The mountains, beaches and Boston are only an hour away.\r\n\r\nSo that our students may make positive contributions to society, the university acknowledges the importance of intellectual, professional and ethical development; community service; cultural involvement; and social responsibility. The university fosters learning partnerships among students, faculty and staff.\r\n\r\nThe university faculty includes individuals who bring practical, professional experience to the learning environment. The university offers a diverse living and learning environment that reflects many ages, races and cultures; ours is the most internationally diverse campus in northern New England. The multicultural, multinational community promotes mutual respect and understanding of others as an integral part of its globally oriented educational purpose. Southern New Hampshire University leads in the development of educational programs and services which reflect the changing demands and needs of students and society, thus enabling graduates to compete in the global economy."

            "Since 1878, Southwest Baptist University has been an evangelical Christian University with a long-standing Baptist heritage. As a distinctly Christian university, integrating faith with every academic pursuit is the cornerstone of an SBU education. We are committed to helping students grow mentally and spiritually. We encourage every student to integrate knowledge, character and faith into their everyday lives with the goal of preparing to be servant leaders in a global society. The academic quality of SBU students can be seen from these recognitions: The Forensics Team (speech and debate) has won the national championship of the Pi Kappa Delta National Forensics Tournament for 19 of the last 26 years; the Students in Free Enterprise (SIFE) team won its 22nd consecutive regional championship in 2006; and our Computer Information Science teams have consistently earned top-10 finishes in national competitions and first-place finishes in Missouri. SBU has a long history of encouraging scholar athletes, many of whom have been named to NCAA Division II Academic All-Americans. The University's objective is to remain an affordable, high-quality, private Christian institution.  Among recent honors: SBU has been named one of America's Best Christian Colleges for 10 consecutive years. For 11 years, SBU has been recognized as one of America's Best College Buys and one of the lowest priced Midwest universities. SBU is one of only eight colleges and universities in the United States being honored with the \"Courts Redford Award for Excellence in Student Missionary Deployment\" by the Southern Baptist Convention's North American Mission Board for SBU's \"strong commitment of excellence\" in deploying student missionaries in 2006. While every department at SBU addresses issues of faith in the classroom, these unique programs offer in-depth emphasis on ethical and cultural issues: The College of Business and Computer Science has adopted Psalm 15 as a guiding principle for students, to graduate servant leadership roles in business and computer science. The Intercultural Studies Program prepares students to answer the call to reach every nation, tribe and tongue through spiritual, academic and practical preparation- including a six-month period of study abroad. The SBU Honors Program recognizes servant leaders for their accomplishments and excellence in academics, intercultural experiences, and spiritual development. SBU students enjoy amenities of a beautiful, small-town campus, 30 minutes from Springfield and 90 minutes from Branson. The campus is close to many beautiful lakes, parks, and the Ozark Mountains."

            "Southwestern College offers a hilly, wooded, 124-year-old campus that is on the cutting edge in technology.  Each student at Southwestern receives a laptop computer that connects to our wireless internet anywhere on the Hill.  A recent survey showed SC students far more satisfied with their interactions with faculty than most students in similar schools across the nation.  This helps our students finish their undergraduate degrees quickly; nearly always a degree can be earned in four years. A master's degree in education, specialized ministries (youth ministry), business, or leadership can be earned in as little as one additional year of on-campus study through the 5th Year Master's Programs. Our service learning teams, Leadership Southwestern, Discipleship Southwestern, and SIFE each have been nationally recognized for excellence.  Now the Green Team has become the newest service learning opportunity, appealing to students of all academic disciplines who take an interest in sustainable energy. Each of these service learning programs offers substantial scholarship opportunities, as do the performing arts, communications, athletics, and other activities.  Students of all faiths find SC a safe harbor to explore their beliefs and grow spiritually."

            ", the United Methodist-affiliated university resides on a small portion of 700 acres in central Texas. Students admitted to the college can choose from 40 majors, 36 minors, and more than 90 student organizations. Greek life is mildly popular on campus, with about one third of the student body participating in a fraternity or sorority. First year students are required to take a two-credit course during fall semester that enlightens them on academic resources and expectations at the university. Students are required to live on campus during their first four semesters at Southwestern but can move off campus once they have achieved junior status. However, more than 85 percent of students live on campus during their college career. Known as the Pirates, Southwestern is a member of the NCAA Division III Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference, and it competes in 16 varsity sports."

            "Saint Anselm College, one of the nation's finest Catholic liberal arts colleges, was founded in 1889 by the world's oldest religious order, the Benedictines. The College is located on a hilltop overlooking Manchester, New Hampshire???s largest city.  The picturesque 400-acre campus is less than an hour???s drive from Boston, the seacoast, the White Mountains, and New Hampshire's Lakes Region.  Dedicated to excellence, Saint Anselm College is noted for its excellent liberal arts education that helps students develop into precise and critical thinkers, articulate and clear communicators, and active and compassionate citizens. The core curriculum that includes its nationally recognized Humanities Program, Portraits of Human Greatness, is a foundation that challenges students to ponder not only the works of our civilizations great men and women, but the people themselves, their values and interests, their decisions and development.  The curriculum also prepares students with the critical skills and competencies that serve them well for success in their professional careers, and for graduate study.  Students who want to be a doctor, teacher, nurse, or lawyer; start their own business or make films???or who simply know they want to make a difference, Saint Anselm provides the options, experience, and mentors to guide them toward their goals.  The College has an outstanding faculty, 92% of whom hold a doctorate or the highest degree in their field.  Guiding students to lead meaningful and balanced lives is also part of our mission and reflected in our many extra-and co-curricular options. The Meelia Center for Community Service and the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, for example, together offer more than 50 different opportunities for students to become civically engaged and globally informed. Named a College with a Conscience by The Princeton Review, and classified by the Carnegie Foundation for Community Engagement & Outreach and Partnerships, Saint Anselm shapes the kind of leader the world is hungry for; not only smart, but good. Through the Meelia Center for Community Service, Saint Anselm College mobilizes student talent and energy to assist 14 community partnerships and more than 30 other community service agencies throughout Greater Manchester. Annually, some 850 students, faculty, and staff volunteer more than 16,000 community service hours. Every four years, New Hampshire serves as a magnet to politicians and the press as the nation's first presidential primary unfolds. The New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College is right in the middle of it all, hosting presidential hopefuls and providing a backdrop for American democracy in action. Over the past 40 years, hundreds of Presidential aspirants have delivered policy speeches at Saint Anselm College. We have also hosted numerous Presidential debates. These events have afforded Saint Anselm College students unique opportunities to participate in American democracy. Some of the candidates who have talked politics at Saint Anselm College have gone on to become American presidents, including the last seven. Saint Anselm and the Institute have become a must stop for the campaigns, providing what The Washington Post calls \"a box seat on America's most riveting political theatre.\"  Student-athletes compete in 20 intercollegiate sports in the Northeast 10 Athletic Conference at the NCAA Division II level.  A well-rounded intramural and recreational program provides opportunities for students at every level of skill to participate in athletic activities."

            "St. Bonaventure University provides a values-based education with individual attention from professors, a beautiful residential setting, and a friendly, close-knit atmosphere. Complementing St. Bonaventure's traditions are innovative degree programs, computerized career placement aids, comprehensive student life activities, and modern academic facilities. \r\nSt. Bonaventure instills in students a passion for learning and living. Our professors are committed and approachable faculty who dedicate themselves to making connections -- among themselves, their courses and, most importantly, their students. Frequently our students work alongside faculty on research projects that are often reserved only for graduate students at other institutions.\r\n\r\nLearning extends far beyond the walls of academic halls at St. Bonaventure, and the essence of that out-of-class experience is service, making a difference in the lives of those in need just down the street or a thousand miles away. Many students take the opportunity to serve as Bona Buddies to area children or senior citizens; help with the national award-winning soup kitchen, The Warming House; or volunteer in one of many service organizations, including SIFE and BonaResponds, one of the most active collegiate disaster relief organizations in the nation. Volunteer opportunities include immersion experiences and service opportunities with the poor, both in the U.S. and abroad.\r\n\r\nIn the past few years, we have invested millions of dollars in updating and expanding our facilities, which has transformed our campus and infused our curriculum. Our new state-of-the-art William F. Walsh Science Center opened in 2008, doubling the space devoted to the sciences at SBU. St. Bonaventure students enjoy two athletic facilities: the $6.2-million Richter Center, a fitness center open 24 hours a day, and the Reilly Center, housing a 5,780-seat sports arena, swimming pool, and weight room. More than 80 percent of St. Bonaventure students take part in intramurals, club sports or fitness programs annually.\r\n\r\nMost of our students live on campus. First-year students may choose to live in one of several floors clustered by themes, featuring specialized programming for common interests. Select upper-class student leaders live in these residence halls, serving as Resident Assistants and Mentors.\r\nSt. Bonaventure is accredited by the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools and the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE). Our School of Business has joined an elite group, achieving accreditation of its bachelor's and master's degree programs in business from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB)."

            "Stetson University is a small private liberal arts university with a historic main campus in DeLand, Florida, between Orlando and Daytona, and a College of Law in Gulfport. From its founding in 1883, Stetson University has affirmed the importance of spiritual life and the quest for truth in its educational mission. The University motto, Pro Deo et Veritate (\"For God and Truth\"), is a symbol of this commitment, and expresses our determination to integrate the pursuit of a liberal education with the search for meaning in our lives and communities. Stetson today offers undergraduate and pre-professional programs in its College of Arts and Sciences, School of Business Administration, and School of Music.  Graduate programs are offered in selected fields--Business, Teacher Education, Counselor Education, and English--and the College of Law offers the J.D. and Master of Law degrees as well as a joint J.D./MBA degree.  Innovative graduate programs are also offered in new academic centers in the planned community of Celebration (Education and Business) and in downtown Tampa (Law). In all these programs, Stetson is committed to academic excellence, liberal learning, and the integration of values in the teaching-learning process.  Through Stetson Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) grants, students complete a summer research project in the field of their choice while receiving a stipend. All students in the College of Arts and Sciences are required to complete a research project prior to graduation.  The research requirements in the College of Arts and Sciences have led to students receiving undergraduate awards such as the Truman scholarship and outstanding graduate school fellowships in the nation's leading research universities.  Stetson's exceptional music program has produced many outstanding performers and music educators.  A recent example is Donovan Singletary, a senior Voice major who won the National Council Grand Finals on the stage of the New York City Metropolitan Opera, singing with the Met Orchestra.  The School of Music also offers students the opportunity to combine their degree in music with any other field offered by the university.  A popular combination allows music students to earn a bachelor's in music and an MBA in Stetson's School of Business Administration.  The Roland George Investments Program offers a unique program of advanced education in investment management that equips students for positions in financial institutions such as banks, trust companies, brokerage firms and investment advisory firms. Stetson students in the program assume full responsibility for active management of a portfolio valued at approximately $3 million. They also are national champions in an annual portfolio management competition, and perform their research in a state-of-the-art trading room which contains computing resources, software such as Bridge and Bloomberg, and a real-time ticker and data wall.  Stetson's Family Business Center offers the nation's first major devoted to family enterprises.  Established in 1998, the Family Business Center is known for its holistic model, which examines both family and business issues in running, owning and working for a family business.  This program is focused on both the next generation from family businesses and those destined to be advisers to such organizations be that as an accountant, lawyer, or business adviser.  \r\nStetson University offers a wide variety of international programs, including  study abroad in France, Germany, Hong Kong, Mexico, Russia, Spain, and Oxford in the United Kingdom.  Stetson also offers three summer programs: intensive Spanish language study in Mexico, business in Austria, and liberal arts in Germany. There are internship opportunities in Germany, England and Latin America. In addition, each year professors lead short Off-Campus Programs abroad during semester breaks. Past programs have taken place in Turkey, Greece, England and the Czech Republic."

            "Innovation and entrepreneurship is stressed at Stevens Institute of Technology, a research-intensive school primarily known for its engineering, science, and management programs. The school also has a liberal arts division with six majors. Undergraduate students are encouraged to get involved in research projects and develop new technologies through the school’s Technogenesis philosophy. Students can opt for a cooperative education track, which is a five-year program with mostly alternating semesters of class and full-time, paid work. Students complete a full first and fifth year at Stevens, and pay for only four years of school. On campus, in Hoboken, N.J., there are more than 120 clubs and organizations, including about 15 fraternities and sororities. Housing is guaranteed for four years, and 90 percent of students choose to live on campus. The campus lies along the Hudson River, and New York City is a boat ride away. The Stevens Ducks compete in the NCAA Division III Eastern College Athletic Conference, and, through the school’s Adopt-a-Team program, all student athletes have a faculty mentor to help them juggle sports and school work. To ease the first-year transition, students can spend two weeks on campus the summer before freshman year through the Exploring Career Options in Engineering & Science (E.C.O.E.S.) program. During the session, students will compete in research competitions, visit local employers, and complete engineering and science projects. Incoming freshmen also do not have the hassle of buying a new laptop; each student is given a notebook computer with software configured to his or her major. The school was exclusively for male students until 1971, and now, females make up close to 30 percent of the student body."

            "Stevenson University is Maryland's third largest independent university with more than 3,400 students pursuing bachelor's, master's, and adult accelerated degrees in the classroom and online. Founded in 1947 as Villa Julie College, the University is committed to providing a career-focused education, using its Career Architecture process to help students align their career goals with their personal interests, values, and academic coursework. Through innovative approaches, distinctive programs, personalized attention, and an emphasis on practical and experiential learning, Stevenson University links higher education to today's job market, graduating students with the competence and confidence needed to chart their careers paths. Stevenson's approach pays off: employment rates for Stevenson graduates have remained consistently strong despite the nation???s economic challenges. Ninety-five percent of the Class of 2009 found work or began pursuing an advanced degree within six months of graduation.  Over the past decade, the University has expanded from its original 64-acre Greenspring  campus outside of Baltimore to a second campus in Owings Mills, Maryland. Opened in 2004 with seven apartment-style student residences and a community center, the 100-acre campus has transformed the University from a local commuter school to a regional institution with more than 1,300 resident students. The Owings Mills campus now includes 11 student residence halls with the opening of the University's newest residence, Wooded Way, designed to house specialized student learning communities. The growth continues with the addition of new 60,000-square-foot gymnasium and athletic complex set to open in fall 2010. Stevenson recently added football to its roster of 19 NCAA Division III men's and women's sports, and the University's men's lacrosse team entered 2010 ranked No. 2 in the nation after an outstanding 2009 season. From the opening of the Brown School of Business and Leadership to the addition of Maryland's first middle school teacher preparation program, as well as new bachelor's programs in criminal justice and fashion merchandising, Stevenson continues to expand its offerings and embrace technology, online teaching, and accelerated learning to bring career-focused programs to traditional and non-traditional students alike."

            "Minutes from Manhattan, St. Francis College is the Small College of Big Dreams.  With small classes taught only by professors, numerous internship opportunities and highly successful alumni who actively mentor undergraduates, students are offered a wealth of opportunities that will put them on the path to success in both their personal and professional lives.\r\nFor more than 150 years, the mission of St. Francis has been to provide an affordable, quality education to working class people who otherwise may not be able to attend college.  Hundreds of successful graduates were the first in their family to attend college.  Merit based scholarships that can include full tuition for graduating high school students with a 1200 on their SAT's  are the cornerstone of the College's financial aid program.  Additional partial scholarships for students with SAT scores ranging from 970 to 1050, as well as $3,000 and $5,000 academic achievement grants are also part of the generous aid packages.\r\nStudents participate on 19 Division I athletic teams, including Men's and Women's Basketball, Men's Soccer, Women's Volleyball and the nationally ranked Men's Water Polo team and Women's Bowling team.\r\nMajors at St. Francis range from classic liberal arts to pre-professional concentrations like Sports Management.  A five-year combined Bachelor's and Master's degree in Accounting is also offered with graduates accepting jobs at both Big Four Accounting Firms and private companies.  Other students take advantage of the unique HDTV production studio and art theater.\r\nThe Franciscan Tradition of the College ensures an educational environment that supports students and helps develop the whole person.  All incoming freshman are required to take a one credit course entitled SFC 1001 which teaches time and stress management, success strategies, how to search for a major and a career, as well as where to get help while at St. Francis.  Many go on to take SFC 2001, a life lessons course aimed at helping students in their sophomore year.  This course gives students practical advice on things like how to search for a job or graduate school, how to prepare for an interview and how to make and keep connections with successful graduates of St. Francis.\r\nSt. Francis College expects all students to not just take classes and go home.  They can join more than 40 clubs of varying interests, fraternities and sororities as well as honor societies.  Students should become a vibrant part of the community, learning about social responsibility and mutual respect.  These are the ingredients that allow St. Francis students to achieve their dreams."

            "St. Gregory's University has a bold vision: Building the Kingdom of God through education in the Catholic and Benedictine tradition.  The Benedictine tradition emphasizes a life of balance fostered in community, and so welcomes students from a variety of backgrounds.  A 4-semester, chronologically ordered sequence of discussion-based seminars required of all freshmen and sophomores in which students will wrestle with some of the most influential texts and ideas of the Western and Catholic intellectual traditions. (A modified 2-semester sequence is required of all transfer students who arrive at SGU with more than 45 credits.)  Each seminar group (14-16 students) will meet weekly for an 80 minute session.  Four times throughout the semester, all students enrolled in each seminar level will gather for a 75 minute public lecture/presentation designed to provide important background (historical, philosophical, literary, cultural) for upcoming readings. Extracurricular activities include 11 varsity athletic teams, an active performing arts program, active roles in campus ministry, and many opportunities for leadership.  The Buckley Outreach Team presents retreats and workshops exploring the Catholic faith and life for high school youth in Oklahoma and surrounding states.  St. Gregory's University also provides adult accelerated degree programs, at the Associate, Bachelor and Master levels, through the College for Working Adults at the Shawnee campus and in Tulsa."

            "St. John’s University is a Roman Catholic institution open to students of all faiths. The school is located in New York City, in the borough of Queens, but also has New York campuses in Staten Island and Manhattan. On campus, there are more than 150 academic, professional, and recreational student organizations, including the St. John’s Bread and Life program that provides support and services for the poor. Greek life is and has been a part of campus life since 1956. Because of its location in New York City, all St. John’s freshmen are required to complete a course called Discover New York. This introduction to the city allows students to examine New York through a variety of academic disciplines. The Red Storm of St. John’s University is a member of the Big East Conference in the NCAA Division I. The university’s athletic program fields 16 intercollegiate teams but is most well known for its men’s basketball team, which is among the top 10 programs nationally with the most NCAA tournament appearances."

            "Saint Joseph's core curriculum is a nationally recognized, interdisciplinary sequence of general education courses spread over 8 semesters (4 years).  Through this curriculum, SJC students gain academic knowledge, superior communication skills, a broad worldview, and a strong sense of self-confidence.  Exceptional emphasis is placed on the education of the whole person, achieved by the complementarity of Core to the major.  A student is able to immediately study in the academic program of interest.  If a student is still contemplating an academic program or career, there is great opportunity to explore a variety of subjects before committing to a specific field.  Highly personalized advising helps students who follow a prescribed sequence of courses to finish typically in four years.  The value of this educational investment skyrockets as students have the chance to get involved early and often at SJC.  Our faculty consists of professors with proven credentials.  They are committed to teaching, eager to help students succeed, and accessible to students.  Rensselaer is a safe and friendly community of 5,500 residents and is within easy driving distance to major cities such as Chicago and Indianapolis (90 minutes each)."

            "Saint Joseph's University is a nationally recognized, Catholic, Jesuit university. For more than 150 years, Saint Joseph's has advanced the professional and personal ambitions of men and women by providing a rigorous Jesuit education--one that demands high achievement, expands knowledge, deepens understanding, stresses effective reasoning and communication, develops moral and spiritual character, and imparts enduring pride. One of only 129 schools with a Phi Beta Kappa chapter and business school accreditation by AACSB International (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business), Saint Joseph's  is home to 4,550 traditional, full-time undergraduates studying in 40 academic majors and over 900 challenging courses.  In addition, the distinguished research faculty concentrate on teaching and approximately 98 percent hold doctoral or terminal degrees. Faculty make students a priority and foster one-on-one mentoring relationships with students.  Through the Summer Scholar's Program, students can conduct original research under the guidance of a faculty mentor and earn a stipend while doing so.  At Saint Joseph's, we define academic excellence by a high-quality curriculum, expert faculty, and our talented student body. In the College of Arts and Sciences, students select a major among three divisions: humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences and mathematics. Whether it is through reading the classics as an English major or discussing world politics as an international relations major, students in the College of Arts and Science not only develop a perspective on the world, but also learn to use that perspective to make a difference in their respective fields. At the Erivan K. Haub School of Business (HSB), the world's future leaders are taught by professors who achieved incredible success in their own corporate careers. Students are not merely taught in classrooms but in state-of-the art academic facilities, including a Wall Street Trading Room. Students may also take advantage of the Cooperative Education program, which integrates formal classroom training with paid work experience.  Home of the largest program in Food Marketing in the U.S. and the Pedro Arrupe Center for Business Ethics, HSB sculpts its young men and women to be innovative, professional, successful and ethical business leaders. A Saint Joseph's education is not only earned in the classroom. Many Hawks spend their semester breaks volunteering in the Gulf Coast, Appalachia, New Mexico and beyond, proving that being men and women for others isn't simply an ideal but a way of life.  At the Career Development Center, students are assisted for life after Saint Joseph's.  In a recent post-graduate survey, over 94 percent of graduates were either employed full time, in graduate school or pursuing volunteer opportunities.  Education is also cultivated on the fields and courts of 20 NCAA Division I teams; through membership in over 100 activities and organizations; and in the communities of the residence halls. Saint Joseph's students are a dynamic group of individuals, committed to academic excellence, as diverse in their interests as they are in their backgrounds, yet united by a drive to succeed and improve the world around them. One of Saint Joseph's goals is to make a 21st century collegiate education an affordable reality for all those prepared to strive for excellence and balance in both learning and living. Over 85 percent of our students receive merit and/or need based financial assistance. Hawk Hill is an attractive 100-acre campus noted for its distinctive architecture, located in a suburban setting on the western edge of historic Philadelphia. Saint Joseph's provides ready access to the vast career opportunities and cultural resources of America's fifth-largest city, while affording students a cohesive and intimate campus experience."

            "New York’s oldest coed university resides in the village of Canton. Founded in 1856, St. Lawrence University is a private college. Though the university is non-denominational today, leaders of the Universalist Church founded it. St. Lawrence runs one of the oldest first-year programs in the country. Freshmen that are admitted to the university live on campus with other students that are taking the same courses during the first semester. Participation in Greek life at St. Lawrence is substantially lower than in past years. There are less than 10 fraternities and sororities, although these chapters do continue to have an active role in campus life. Students interested in extracurricular activities can choose from more than 100 student groups. The Saint Lawrence Saints are members of the Liberty League in the NCAA Division III,  but the school does have an Eastern College Athletic Conference Hockey League (ECACHL) Division I hockey team. The university fields more than 30 varsity sports and more than 40 percent of the student body participates."

            "Founded in 1889, Saint Leo University is now recognized as one of the nation's leading Catholic teaching universities and a school of international consequence.  Our main campus in Saint Leo, Florida--35 minutes north of Tampa--is home to our vibrant University College, serving the education needs of more that 1500 traditional-age undergraduate students.  The university also offers a variety of dynamic graduate programs; a weekend and evening program for working adults; both undergraduate and graduate degree programs through 17 education centers in six states and through our Center for Online Learning, which houses the university's cutting-edge online degree programs.  \r\n\r\nAt Saint Leo University, outstanding teaching and active learning go hand in hand.  Caring and capable faculty provide our students with knowledge, guidance, academic support, and a broad range of learning opportunities--both in and outside the classroom.  Small classes allow faculty to give each student personal attention.  A recent nation-wide survey on student engagement confirms that Saint Leo University students rate their interaction with faculty significantly higher than do students at other similar universities.  And our students tell us they love the university's active teaching-learning model because it enables them to collaborate on assignments, discuss readings, and participate in research projects outside the classroom.  Not many universities can boast, as we can, that their undergraduate students are encouraged to present their work at national, academic and professional conferences.\r\n\r\nMany of our alumni tell us that their bonds with faculty have remained strong over the years.  They say the mentoring, coaching, and other outside-the-classroom interactions with faculty helped them achieve much more than they ever thought possible.   They report that they learned not just how to succeed in the classroom, but also in life.  As students they were encouraged to be well-rounded: to learn, to think for themselves, to be active participants, and to give back to their communities.  Today, Saint Leo University continues to encourage service-learning.  In a recent student survey, 95 percent of University College freshmen and 82 percent of seniors said they perform community service each year.  \r\n\r\nSaint Leo University is a place where values are more than just words on a wall.  Respect, integrity, personal development, responsible stewardship, community, and excellence are part of the daily fabric of life on our main campus and throughout the university system.  Our values derive from our Benedictine traditions and from our commitment to make our students love the person they will become.  These values are what make Saint Leo students and its graduates special."

Founded and continually sponsored by the Sisters of the Holy Cross since 1844, the College embraces its Catholic heritage and educates its students within that context. On this mostly residential campus (more than 80 percent of students live here), Saint Mary's mission is to offer women a solid foundation in the liberal arts, a wide variety of challenging majors, and excellent preparation for leadership roles in both career and community. Saint Mary's College has always engaged its students with a learning atmosphere that allows open discussion and close interaction between classmates and professors. That personal attention is one of the qualities Saint Mary's students say they value most about their educational experience. The curriculum offers enhanced learning opportunities, including challenging and interesting coursework and interdisciplinary study. The College also offers a wide variety of academic-year, summer, and semester break options for international study. With an emphasis on creativity, teamwork, critical thinking, ethics, and intercultural competence, graduates are prepared for an array of careers and a lifetime of learning. The College's single-gender environment has been proven, in study after study, to foster confidence, ethical leadership, and strong academic success among women. Graduates of women's colleges tend to be remarkable achievers. Saint Mary's alumnae include a Broadway producer, several U.S. Congresswomen, a state Supreme Court justice, a vice president for CBS Sports, the 2006 Michigan School Superintendent of the Year, and a country director for Save the Children in Afghanistan. Saint Mary's students often declare that their college experience gives them the best of both worlds: small classes and unlimited opportunities. When students graduate and embark on a career or enter graduate school, they are armed with the skills employers and others are looking for: the ability to communicate well, to think analytically, and to see the big picture."

            "Founded in 1863, Saint Mary's College of California is one of the oldest colleges in the West. Saint Mary's has been directed since 1868 by the Christian Brothers, the largest Catholic order dedicated exclusively to teaching. The founder of the order, Saint John Baptist de La Salle, is the patron saint of teachers. Saint Mary's is shaped by three traditions: Catholic, LaSallian, and liberal arts. Our Catholic tradition encourages an appreciation of all faiths, a respect for the dignity of human life, a willingness to explore the mystery of existence, and an understanding of the whole person, mind and body, soul and spirit.  Our LaSallian tradition encourages a commitment to social justice and to transformative teaching - a shared investigation of faith, reason, and the diversity of human experience.  Our liberal arts tradition means that we are dedicated to profound reflection and worldly experience, critical thinking and global awareness, integrated scholarship and lifelong learning. Our academic program includes advanced study in 30 major fields - in the arts and humanities, the sciences and social sciences, education and business.  Our labs and classes are small-averaging around 20 students and student-centered, enabling intense discussion, lively debates, and a strong sense that ideas matter.  Our rigorous core curriculum includes the Collegiate Seminar, a series of discussion-based classes examining the world's great ideas.  The January Term program allows students to pursue a single specialized topic in depth.  We are committed to experiential learning; students take advantage of an extensive study abroad program and internships, research, and service opportunities.  Many of our nearly 200 full-time professors are internationally renowned for their research and scholarship; all are skilled teachers and dedicated mentors. \r\nSaint Mary's is home to nearly 2,500 undergraduates from across the country and around the world. Our student body is unusually diverse; more than 40% of our undergraduates identify themselves as African American, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino American, or Native American.  And our students are unusually active: they manage dozens of clubs and organizations, play on our 14 Division I teams, and coordinate our extensive recreation program.  Our Catholic Institute for Lasallian Social Action is a nationally recognized center for social service; every year, nearly half of our students join a service project.  Resident students live in thirteen residence halls and eight townhouse complexes; residential life is guided by trained student advisors, professional staff, and more than two dozen Christian Brothers.\r\nOur 420-acre campus is set among rolling hills and marked by a stately chapel, villa-style architecture, quiet courtyards, and fragrant pines.  The most recent additions to the campus include the Syufy Performing Arts Center and our state-of-the-art science facility.  The College is 20 miles east of San Francisco, one of the world's cultural and commercial Meccas, and is surrounded by natural treasures, from redwood forests to the pacific coastline, from spectacular mountain ranges to alpine lakes."

Students are required to take, at a minimum, the Bible in Culture and Community course and a class on Christian theology. All but about 175 students live on campus at this residential college, and alcohol is not allowed on the premises. There is no Greek system, but students have more than 150 other student clubs and organizations to check out. More than a third of students are active in one of the many musical organizations, including eight choirs and two orchestras, and the school broadcasts its weekly Sing for Joy music and sermon radio series across the country. Student musicians can also perform in the St. Olaf Christmas Festival, a long-standing musical tradition that is broadcast on PBS. The Oles sports teams compete in the NCAA Division III Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in traditional college sports as well as Nordic and alpine skiing. The school mascot is a costumed lion named Ole. St. Olaf has a large, wooded campus in Northfield, Minn. and is surrounded by college-owned farmland and prairies.",

            "Stonehill College, founded by the Congregation of Holy Cross in 1948, is an academically challenging, welcoming community on a beautiful, vibrant campus just outside of Boston. Our mission is \"to educate the whole person so that each graduate thinks, acts, and leads with courage toward the creation of a more just and compassionate world.\" EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING: Stonehill is in the top 10% of colleges nationwide in enriching educational experiences such as internships, study abroad, and co-curricular programs, according to the National Survey of Student Engagement. Over 80% of our students complete an internship, study abroad, or practicum and field experience by the time they graduate. Stonehill students intern nationally and internationally in locations from New York City, Washington, D.C., and Boston to Dublin, London, Paris, and Geneva. The Institute of International Education ranks Stonehill 16th in the country among baccalaureate institutions for semester study abroad programs. A total of 262 Stonehill students studied abroad this academic year, in programs that spanned 24 countries from China to Russia and South Africa to New Zealand. CORNERSTONE PROGRAM: The core of Stonehill's \"liberal arts-plus\" curriculum is the Cornerstone Program. Through this initiative, students are prepared for a life of learning, leadership, and responsible citizenship by taking interdisciplinary Learning Communities, courses in ethics, the sciences, language, and more, and a major Capstone course for seniors in which students demonstrate mastery of their academic discipline. INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION: Classes are kept small so that Stonehill's accomplished and accessible faculty can champion and challenge our students during all four years. Since its inception in 1996, the Stonehill Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) Program has involved 325 students working alongside professors to conduct, publish, and present research in a broad range of disciplines from biochemistry to education. ATHLETICS MEET ACADEMICS: Stonehill ranks #2 in NCAA Division II academic/athletic colleges in the country according to the National Collegiate Scouting Association, as well as ranking consistently at the top level across all three NCAA Divisions, including powerhouses such as Duke, Stanford, and Notre Dame. Over 50% of students involved in athletic programs achieve GPAs of 3.2 or higher; the average GPA of all 400+ current student-athletes is 3.1. CHARACTER AND VALUES: As a Catholic college, Stonehill has a strong commitment to community service. Each year, approximately 1,600 Stonehill students participate in volunteer outreach. Last year, our students provided more than 41,000 hours of service to numerous nonprofit and civic groups. Our significant opportunities for community service this year include ten alternative spring break H.O.P.E. trips for nearly 200 students to sites from Honduras to New Orleans and Tennesse. Since their inception in 1998, more than 700 students have gone on H.O.P.E. trips in the U.S. and abroad. STRONG OUTCOMES: Our students and alumni succeed because the entire college community collaborates to help them develop the knowledge, skills, and character to meet their professional goals and live lives of purpose and integrity. Of a recent Stonehill graduating class, 92% were employed within one year of graduation at corporations like Goldman Sachs and Brigham and Women's Hospital, 38% attended medical, law, or other graduate programs at institutions like Georgetown and Brown, and 8% joined or applied for a year-long volunteer service program such as the Peace Corps and Teach for America. \"Everyone on campus wants to help you achieve your fullest potential. I think that in a very real sense, getting that sort of nurturing attention makes it easier for you to contribute to the community in turn.\" - John Hanawalt '10"

            "Stony Brook University is one of 64 schools in the State University of New York (SUNY) system. Located on the North Shore of Long Island, the university is accessible by car, train, and ferry, and many students choose to commute. Freshmen do not have to live on campus. Academic activity pauses each Wednesday from 12:40 to 1:10 p.m. for Campus Life Time, when students can check out free concerts, sample free food, and take a break from the rigor of classes. Annually, students gather for events like the Roth Pond Regatta, a race of student-made cardboard boats, and the Shirley Strum Kenny Student Arts Festival, a week of student work showcases. Students can also check out nearly 300 student organizations on campus, including about 30 fraternities and sororities. On the athletic fields, the Stony Brook Seawolves compete in the NCAA Division I America East Conference. For a workout off the field, students can bike and hike around Stony Brook’s large, wooded campus, which includes the Ashley Schiff Park Preserve. For an urban experience, New York City is about 60 miles away."

            "The special character of Saint Peter's College is defined by its Jesuit heritage, size, diversity, location, student life, and affordability. One of 28 U.S. Jesuit colleges and the only Jesuit college in NJ, St. Peter's is committed to academic excellence and to developing graduates to learn, to lead and to serve society. With a ratio of one faculty to thirteen students, the College is ideally sized. Total enrollment is approximately 3,000 students.  More than half of the freshman class resides on campus. Our remarkably diverse students originate from around U.S. and more than 60 countries. While providing personal attention, the College is large enough to offer 40 majors, an Honors Program, internships, service learning, study abroad, and a Washington semester. Joint professional degree programs include Law, Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Physician Assistant, Physical Therapy, Clinical Lab Sciences, and Pharmacy. St. Peter's location is also ideal.  The main campus is on 25 acres in the heart of Jersey City, the second largest city in New Jersey, and just 12 minutes by train from the cultural and financial resources of New York City.  Campus life is enhanced by 40 student-run organizations and 20 NCAA Division I teams. Committed to affordability, St. Peter's offers among the lowest tuitions of the Jesuit Colleges: 97% of students receive financial aid and the average award is $20,000."

            "The SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry offers students a niche education with the benefits of life at a large institution. ESF, as the small school is known for short, offers about 20 Bachelor of Science degrees ranging from Aquatics and Fisheries Science to Paper Engineering, as well as a Landscape Architecture program. Students can get a broader experience, however, through neighbor school", 
            ". The two institutions, both located in Syracuse, N.Y., have a collegiate partnership. ESF students can enroll in courses, live in residence halls, use campus facilities, and join student organizations at Syracuse University. ESF and Syracuse students even graduate in a joint commencement ceremony each May. All ESF freshmen must live on the school’s campus, however. The school has its own array of about 25 clubs. The ESF Mighty Oaks sports teams compete in the United States Collegiate Athletic Association, comprised of small schools, and students can take part in club and intramural sports at Syracuse. ESF has an additional campus in the Adirondack Mountains, called the Ranger School, where students study forest technology during their sophomore year. The Ranger School offers associate degree completion programs, as well as courses toward a bachelor’s degree. Earth Day is a weeklong celebration at the environmental school, with events like yoga on the campus quad, student-wide barbecues, and volunteer clean-ups of local streams."

            "Mission: The State University of New York College at Plattsburgh prepares a diverse population of undergraduate and graduate students for a wide range of careers based on a strong foundation in the liberal arts. The college is a selective public institution offering a high-quality and affordable education. SUNY Plattsburgh supports students in the discovery and cultivation of their potential for leadership in their chosen careers and communities. We challenge students to think, learn, and excel through both close interactions with an outstanding faculty and staff and participation in rewarding experiential learning opportunities. We are committed to academic excellence, ethical values, lifelong learning, and responsible citizenship in a sustainable global community. SUNY Plattsburgh contributes to the cultural enrichment and economic development of the Northeastern New York region. Attributes: Our distinctive location, near Lake Champlain, the Adirondack Mountains, and Canada, is embraced in academic programs, recreational activities, and community involvement. For instance, through our connection with the W. H. Miner Institute, students have access to 8,600 acres of forests and agricultural land to use as an outdoor laboratory, working on issues like preserving the Adirondack Park, as they study earth and environmental science. Others work in the Lake Champlain Research Institute, where they fight invasive species, identify insects and more. They have even helped develop and write the computer code for an Algal Bloom Mapper, which locates potentially hazardous algae blooms in the lake. The Expeditionary Studies program also makes use of the landscape to teach advanced skills in rock and ice climbing, back-country skiing, and sea kayaking. These lessons are combined with materials from different disciplines, including history, leadership, land management, environmental science, ethics, and education. Proximity to Canada makes the college a perfect place to study the growing field of global supply chain management. In fact, the college was the first in the SUNY system to offer this program. The Plattsburgh State Art Museum is comprised of over 4,600 works of art and artifacts ranging from antiquities to contemporary art. Through its Museum Without Walls, students are able to view art across the campus. The college also houses what may be the largest collection of skeletal remains from the ancient Maya, housed with permission from the Belize government. Combined with a DNA sequencer, these allow for unique opportunities to unlock mysteries of the past. Dr. Nancy Elwess, winner of the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring, has been working with undergraduates on this and more. For five years in a row, her students have won national and international awards for this work. In biology, our students founded the first-ever student chapter of the Botanical Society of America and won awards from that group. One student traveled to Australia with faculty where she helped them discover a new plant species. Our students are also winning awards for video and audio productions. They won 20 out of 34 regional awards and three national awards from the National Broadcasting Society this year. Our students take part in unique experiences through our Spectrum clinics. These allow them to apply classroom learning to a clinical setting and do meaningful research in speech and hearing, Alzheimer's, traumatic brain injury and autism. SUNY Plattsburgh has a long tradition as a teachers college, with education alumni recently winning awards from the president of the United States, the New York State Department of Education, the School Administrators Association and more. Now, our redesigned program has reset the bar, adjusting it to the needs of the 21st century, with an emphasis on inquiry-based teaching and programs in which students may be working in schools the first semester of their freshman year."

            "Susquehanna University is a distinctive, national liberal arts college committed to academic excellence. Its mission is to prepare undergraduates for productive and reflective lives of achievement, leadership and service in a diverse and interconnected world. In a collaborative and inclusive community, Susquehanna University offers students a balance of liberal arts and professional programs led by passionate faculty mentors with access to exceptional facilities. The school fosters a results-oriented education strong in experiential learning. With a distinctive cross-cultural requirement that takes students out of their usual range of everyday living and exposes them to cultures different from their own, students broaden their educational experience. They gain transferable skills from numerous transformative experiences such as internships, service learning and leadership opportunities. The university also puts a premium on close interaction between students and faculty. Faculty, for example, work closely with students on research, encouraging discovery, understanding and collaboration in the theoretical and applied, concrete and abstract, known and unknown. These interactions help prepare students for graduate school or their chosen profession. Many of Susquehanna students are service-oriented; they participate in and even initiate a variety of projects that make a difference close to campus and around the world.  This service instills a heightened sense of responsibility and commitment that persists long after graduation.  \r\nThe university instills in its students the best qualities of a residential college and a challenging university, helping students develop self-confidence, intellectual skills, independence and an appetite for learning. Beyond academic commitments, Susquehanna students enjoy an active and comfortable lifestyle on campus and in the borough of Selinsgrove, which is located on the scenic Susquehanna River. Their experience is enriched by a Division III sports program, as well as an array of intramural and club sports, visual and performing arts, clubs and service organizations. After graduation, students become part of an increasingly proud and supportive alumni community that attests to the value and the many benefits that Susquehanna students glean from their undergraduate years."

Swarthmore has 22 NCAA Division III varsity sports teams cheered on by mascot Phineas the Phoenix. The school only has two fraternities and no sororities, as they were abolished in the 1930s.

            ", the television channel. The school’s sports teams are known simply as The Orange, and are cheered on in the NCAA Division I Big East Conference by school mascot Otto the Orange. The football team plays in Carrier Dome, famed as the only domed stadium in the Northeast. The school’s campus sits on University Hill, above the sprawling city of Syracuse in central New York state. With about 100 inches of snowfall each year, the bitter cold winters at Syracuse University give students plenty of opportunities for skiing, snowboarding, and sledding on nearby mountains. On campus, there are more than 300 student clubs and organizations. About 20 percent of Syracuse students are involved in Greek life, though only juniors and seniors may live in Greek housing. All freshmen and sophomore students must live in on-campus housing. The free Connective Corridor bus shuttles transport students between campus and downtown Syracuse, where annual celebrations include a 12-day Winterfest and a Jazz Fest."

The safety of the small community extends to the well-lighted campus where security measures include an emergency message notification system (e-mail, phone and text message), emergency call boxes and continuous patrolling by the university's 17 commissioned police officers who work closely with the professional town police force. Entrance to all residence halls is by card-access only and, for extra security, classrooms may be locked from inside."

The college offers a variety of undergraduate majors and one graduate program in elementary education. Known for its undergraduate programs in education and preparation for broad-based ministry, the institution is a liberal arts college, not a Bible-college even though Bible classes are required of each graduate. The institution attracts students who are committed to scholarship, servant leadership, and  service in church and community. The student-centered campus with a low faculty-student ratio exhibits a climate of personal attention, respect, inclusion and high expectations."

            "At the core of the liberal arts education offered at Bridgewater College is a distinctive program known as the Personal Development Portfolio (PDP) program. The PDP program, required for all students, is a comprehensive approach encouraging students to cultivate four dimensions of personal development: intellectual growth and discovery, citizenship and community responsibility,ethical and spiritual growth, and emotional maturation and physical health.  The program centerpiece is the personal development portfolio, which all students complete prior to graduation. Personal essays are completed each year as the student reflects on specific experiences that were significant or meaningful in his or her life. The complete portfolio includes documentation of achievement in all four dimensions, including participation in service-learning, the student's resume and evidence of career planning. This commitment to personal development is an outgrowth of Bridgewater College's mission to educate and develop the whole person."

            "Student life centers on religion and responsibility at Brigham Young University—Provo, a school founded and supported by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (also known as Mormon). There are more than 70 clubs on campus, which meet Tuesday evenings. Each Wednesday, a student volunteer coalition completes community service projects around campus. There is no Greek system at BYU. The BYU Cougars compete in the NCAA Division I-A Mountain West Conference. The football team is known for the number of players drafted by the NFL: more than 70 in the past 30 years. All BYU students can participate in the intramural sports, and about 25,000 choose to do so. Freshmen do not have to live on the Provo, Utah, campus, though the school encourages it. All students live according to a strict honor code, which prohibits—among other things–camping with members of the opposite sex and growing a beard without a doctor’s approval. Extramarital and gay sex are also prohibited. Situated at the base of the Wasatch Mountains, the campus is close to plentiful climbing, hiking, and biking opportunities. Provo is also home to the Missionary Training Center, where students of the Latter-day Saints faith can enroll to learn and grow before serving at least 18 months around the world."

            "Ready to be an Aggie? All students assume the nickname at Texas A&M, an academic and athletic powerhouse in central Texas. Once an all-men’s school called the Agricultural and Mechanical College—now shortened to A&M—the university today is coed and has offers a wide variety of majors and activities. Students can choose from more than 800 clubs and organizations, including nearly 60 fraternities and sororities. About 12 percent of students go Greek. More students, about 25 percent, play in Texas A&M intramural sports leagues, one of the largest programs in the country. The school’s varsity sports compete in the NCAA Division I Big 12 Conference, cheered on by mascot Reveille VIII, a collie. Miss Rev, as the collie is known, is also the highest-ranking member in the school’s Cadet Corps, the largest ROTC program in the nation (not including programs at service academies). First-year students interested in community service can get involved right away through the Freshmen in Service and Hosting program (FISH). All students can give back during The Big Event, the largest single-day, student-run volunteer effort in the country in which about 12,500 Aggies work to improve the nearby cities of College Station and Bryan. For many students, these communities are also home; freshmen are not required to live on campus and many choose to live in College Station or Bryan."

There are about 20 religious organizations for students to join, among about 200 others. Greek life is a popular option, with close to 40 percent of the student body involved in about 30 fraternities and sororities. Freshmen and sophomores must live on campus, unless they are older than 21 or commute from a parent’s home. The Horned Frog sports teams are members of the NCAA Division I Mountain West Conference and are especially competitive in football. The unusual mascot is a small lizard and is also the official state animal of Texas. Volunteer activities are a particularly big draw for students, and the school’s Center for Community Involvement & Service-Learning coordinates excursions like trips to Mexico over spring break. The campus is about five miles from downtown Fort Worth, a historic area that still has an Old West feel. Students can check out live bull riding shows at Billy Bob’s, a restaurant that is billed as the world’s largest honky-tonk, or catch a rodeo at the Cowtown Coliseum. The state capital, Dallas, is about 30 miles away."

            "Texas Tech University is in the midst of the most exciting time in the school's history. As we embark on becoming the state's next national research university, the opportunities for students could not be greater.\r\n\r\nWe are proud to be one of the leading institutions in Texas vying for Tier One research status with the help of a $425 million National Research University Fund approved by voters in November. \r\n\r\nWe are also educating more students than ever, as we posted record enrollments for the past two years; last fall more than 30,000 students attended classes - the most in school history - and we anticipate breaking that record again this fall as both our undergraduate and graduate numbers continue to grow.\r\n\r\nYet despite this growth, Texas Tech has retained the feel of a cozy liberal arts institution. Our students enjoy one-on-one interactions with faculty in a safe and traditional campus atmosphere that offers all the benefits of a major research university.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the past year, Texas Tech's faculty and students chased tornadoes across the Midwest as part of the nation's biggest meteorological manhunt. They pinpointed the meteorite that may have killed the dinosaurs, and played a role in powering up the world's largest particle collider deep beneath the Swiss Alps.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Texas Tech is one of only three public universities in Texas to boast a chapter of the prestigious Phi Beta Kappa honor society. Our chapter received the society's highest possible rating for 2008-2009 and is in consideration for the Exemplary Chapter Award that Phi Beta Kappa will present to three schools in 2012.\r\n\r\nEstablished in 1923, Texas Tech sits on a 1,840-acre campus that features expansive lawns, impressive landscaping and Spanish Renaissance-style architecture. It is located in Lubbock, Texas - a thriving city of more than 218,000 people that is the economic and medical hub of a 26-county region larger than most states. \r\n\r\nThe university offers more than 150 bachelor's degrees, 100 master's degrees and 50 doctoral degree choices.  Plus, as part of the Texas Tech University System, Texas Tech shares the same campus with its sister university the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. The close proximity makes Texas Tech the only institution in the state with undergraduate and graduate schools, a law school and medical school all on the same campus, which facilitates the transition to professional studies. \r\n\r\nWorried about getting swallowed up in the crowd? Don't. Lubbock is large enough to offer many of the same shopping, dining and opportunities you'd find in larger Texas cities such as Dallas or Houston, yet has a friendly and college-focused atmosphere that will make you feel welcome to become a part of the community."

            "Thomas Aquinas College is unique among American colleges and universities.  We hold with confidence that the human mind is capable of knowing the truth about reality, that living according to the truth is necessary for human happiness, and that truth is best comprehended through the harmonious work of faith and reason.   We understand the intellectual virtues to be essential to the pursuit of truth and to the life of reason it presupposes, and we consider the cultivation of those virtues to be the primary work of Catholic liberal education.\r\n\r\nThe academic program designed to achieve this goal is comprehensive and unified; it includes no textbooks or lectures.  Through all four years of their studies and in every course-from philosophy, theology, math, and science to language, music, literature and history-students actually read the greatest written works in those disciplines, both ancient and modern: Homer, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Newton, Maxwell, Einstein, the Founding Fathers of the American republic, Shakespeare and T.S. Eliot, to name a few.  Instead of attending lectures, students gather around tables for careful inquiry in small tutorials, seminars and laboratories.\r\n\r\nThe curriculum challenges students to a disciplined scholarship in the arts and sciences indispensable for critical judgment and genuine wisdom.  One mark of the program's success is the variety of professions and careers graduates enter.  Nearly half attend graduate and professional schools in a wide array of disciplines; among them, philosophy, theology, law, and the sciences are most often chosen."

            "Tougaloo College is one of the oldest historically black colleges and universities in the United States. Its origins can be traced to the Amistad.  Founded in 1869, by the American Missionary Association, Tougaloo College was established on the remains of the John Boddie Plantation.  On a site that once served to enslave, limit and shackle the minds, bodies and spirits of many African Americans now stands an institution representing an intellectual oasis of freedom and ideals. Since its founding, Tougaloo College has developed a national reputation for academic excellence and social commitment, distinguishing itself as a critical educational and community resource for the State of Mississippi and the nation.  \r\n\r\nTougaloo College is a historic and distinctive institution with a storied past and proud legacy. The College remains committed to the vision of providing a quality education to young men and women who often come from challenging circumstances. The College is the leading producer of African-American health professionals educated in the state of Mississippi, claiming 40% of the practicing African-American physicians and dentists among its graduates. It has produced more than 35% of Mississippi's African-American current educators, including teachers, principals, and school superintendents.  Over one-third of the African-American attorneys practicing in Mississippi today are graduates of Tougaloo College.  \r\n\r\nAs one of the nation's premier historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), Tougaloo College is an institution devoted to education in the liberal arts tradition. More than 66 percent of our graduates enroll immediately in graduate or professional school following attainment of their Tougaloo College degrees. The College ranks among the top 50 U.S. institutions whose graduates earn PhDs in science and engineering disciplines and among the top 15 historically black colleges and universities in the graduation of females with undergraduate degrees in the physical sciences. The College has produced more graduates who have completed their PhD degrees through the UNCF-Mellon Doctoral Fellowship Program than any other institution in the nation.   \r\n\r\nThe College takes pride in instilling in its students a hunger for independent critical analysis, sound judgment, aesthetic appreciation, intellectual acuity, and respect for the less fortunate in our society. The College's retention rate of 78% is significantly greater than the national average (60%). Tougaloo College provides a supportive educational environment where students have the benefit of a strong peer community as well as continual access to faculty and support staff. Students who come to Tougaloo College know that they can graduate and obtain a degree without getting lost in the academic maze, which is challenge for many students at larger institutions. Students attending Tougaloo College work with a teaching faculty selected not only for excellence in various subject areas but also for the desire and ability to transmit knowledge effectively and to build a learning environment that enables students to succeed. Tougaloo College faculty (many of whom have won distinguished teaching awards) choose to come to the College because of their strong commitment to liberal arts education and to the mutually enriching pursuit of teaching in a historically black college. A college whose students are promising first generation college enrollees, many with extraordinary needs but all with extraordinary talent and potential. Largely attributable to the quality and commitment of the Tougaloo College faculty, our graduates are outstanding leaders who contribute immeasurably to the economic development and prosperity of the State of Mississippi, the region and the nation."

            "Students at Trinity College live in an intimate setting in the midst of a bustling state capital. The campus is located in Hartford, Conn., a large city where students can do everything from attending concerts at the Comcast and Webster theatres to learning how to shoot a cannon from the Revolutionary War at the Old State House. Attending school in the state’s capital also means students have hundreds of opportunities for internships at various organizations throughout the city. Freshmen must live on campus, and will reside and take classes with other students in their selected First-Year Program. Outside of class, students can choose from about 100 clubs and organizations in which to get involved. There are a handful of Greek organizations on campus, which recruit about 18 percent of students. The Trinity sports teams compete in the NCAA Division III New England Small College Athletics Conference, cheered on by the school mascot, a species of rooster known as the bantam. Don’t get confused in your college search: Trinity College is a common name for schools of various faiths, but this liberal arts school is nondenominational."

            "Truman has forged a national reputation for offering an exceptionally high-quality undergraduate education at a competitive price. A commitment to student achievement and learning is at the core of everything Truman does. This commitment is evidenced by faculty and staff members who recognize the importance of providing students with the opportunity to interact with their professors both in and out of the classroom. With class sizes averaging only 25 students and 93 percent of freshman-level academic courses being taught by professors, students find ample opportunity to ask questions of professors as well as interact with their multi-talented peers. Truman's academic environment is enhanced by a student body that achieves at remarkable levels. The 2009 freshman class had an ACT midrange of 25 to 30 and an average GPA of 3.74 on a 4.00 scale. In addition, numerous opportunities exist for students to engage in experiential learning through study abroad, internships, service learning, and undergraduate research. To encourage active learning and engagement, Truman offers Student-Initiated Courses and Learning Opportunities that allow students to customize their learning experience by creating, coordinating and leading courses and co-curricular projects under the mentorship of our professors. Each year, approximately 1,200 students work side by side with professors on University research projects, gaining greater confidence, knowledge, and skill in their chosen disciplines. With more than 270 University organizations available to students, encompassing service, Greek, honorary, professional, religious, social, political, and recreational influences, Truman students have tremendous opportunities to become involved while enrolled at the University. Truman's Student Activities Board provides popular culture entertainment such as special events like Frank Warren (creator of Post Secret), comic acts such as John Oliver and Demetri Martin, and musical artists like Ben Folds, OneRepublic, and Regina Spektor. In addition, admission to all varsity athletic events, Truman theater productions, and Lyceum Series events is free to Truman students. Recent theater productions have included Jekyll & Hyde the Musical, A Midsummer Night's Dream, and Columbinus. Truman is Missouri's premier liberal arts and sciences university and the only highly selective public institution in the state. The Liberal Studies Program is the heart of Truman's curriculum and is intended to serve as a foundation for all major programs of study offered by the University. Truman's mission is to offer an exemplary undergraduate education, grounded in the liberal arts and sciences, in the context of a public institution of higher learning. Therefore, Truman is providing the kind of education in the liberal arts and sciences that has historically been offered only at private colleges. The program is a blend of two intellectual traditions in higher education, one that emphasizes the traditional thought and learning of the culture as reflected in the classical works produced by it, and the other that emphasizes personal investigation and freedom of discovery. The philosophy behind the Liberal Studies Program is based upon a commitment that Truman has made to provide students with essential skills needed for lifelong learning, breadth across the traditional liberal arts and sciences through exposure to various discipline-based modes of inquiry, and interconnecting perspectives that stress interdisciplinary thinking and integration as well as linkage to other cultures and experiences.  Truman also offers a challenging Honors Scholars Program. This program provides students with the opportunity to select rigorous honors courses to satisfy the liberal arts component of their respective programs. Students who successfully complete this program benefit from a richer academic experience and receive special recognition at graduation."

            "At Tulane University, located in downtown New Orleans, students can experience a thriving—and re-establishing—city that is known for more than just its raucous Mardi Gras celebrations. The school is divided between an Uptown campus, its main location, and a Downtown campus, the center for health science programs. The French Quarter, about four miles from the main campus, is a popular tourist spot known for its music scene, nightlife, and shopping. Freshmen and sophomores must live on campus, unless a student lives locally with parents, is married, or is older than 21. There are more than 200 student organizations on campus, including about 20 sororities and fraternities. About a quarter of students are involved in the Greek system. The Tulane Green Wave sports teams are competitive in the Division I Conference USA, and the school’s colors are olive green and blue. Through Tulane After Dark, students can choose from a variety of evening activities such as concerts, comedy shows, and murder mystery parties. Since Hurricane Katrina, hundreds of students a year have volunteered in community service efforts to rebuild the city."

            "School life is split into three 10 week terms, or trimesters, at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y. On the trimester schedule, students take three classes per term and have an extended winter break. All freshmen are randomly assigned to one of seven Minerva Houses, student and faculty residence communities where students live, take classes, and participate in extracurricular activities. Each house has its own kitchen for students who want to cook their own meals. There are about 100 student clubs and organizations, including more than 15 fraternities and sororities. Most Union sports teams, called Dutchmen, compete in the NCAA Division III Liberty League. The Union men’s and women’s ice hockey teams compete in the Division I ECAC Conference Hockey League. The school mascot is a costumed man known as Dutch. Students can volunteer in the revitalizations efforts going on in downtown Schenectady. New York is about 150 miles away, and more than 60 percent of students travel abroad before graduation. Union College’s global offerings include year programs, trimester stays, and three-week trips known as mini-breaks. Each year, students celebrate the changing seasons at Springfest, a day of concerts by famous performers like Sean Kingston and Matt Nathanson."

            "As the flagship campus of the University of Alabama system, the UA campus is often referred to as “The Capstone.” UA students have more than 250 student organizations to get involved in on campus—and freshmen have to live there, too. There are close to 60 fraternities and sororities in the school’s influential Greek system, which comprises about 6,000 students. The Alabama Crimson Tide sports teams are notorious competitors in the NCAA Division I Southeastern Conference, cheered on by an costumed elephant mascot named Big Al. There is also a men’s and women’s wheelchair basketball program, one of four in the country. The university is located in Tuscaloosa, and students can boat and fish in the nearby Black Warrior River. For a road trip, the city of Birmingham is about 60 miles away."

            "Starting on Old Main's front step with the year 1876, the names of the more than 125,000 University of Arkansas graduates have been chiseled into more than two miles of campus walkways, the names grouped by year of graduation. Today, the University of Arkansas is a nationally competitive, student-centered research university, which recently completed a successful billion-dollar capital campaign. The campaign received a major boost from a historic $300 million dollar gift from the Walton Family Charitable Support Foundation. This largest-ever gift to a public university established and endowed the Honors College, providing financial support to nearly 2,200 honors students. The gift also endowed the graduate school.  The endowment provides more than $300,000 to undergraduates each year for study abroad support and more than $500,000 each year for undergraduate research.  In the last decade , University of Arkansas students have won an incredible number of nationally and internationally prestigious scholarships, awards and fellowships, including: two Gates Cambridge Scholarships, one Rhodes Scholarship, four James Madison Scholarships to support the teaching of the constitution, three British Marshall Scholarships, 32  J. William Fulbright Scholarships, six Rotary Scholarships, eight  David L. Boren Scholarships for International Study, nine Freeman in Asia Scholarships, 20  Gilman Scholarships for Study Abroad, six Harry S. Truman Scholarships in for graduate school, awarded to students in public service, 38  National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships, 34 Goldwater Scholarships in math, science and engineering, four Udall Scholarships in environmental science, and ten USA Today All-College Academic Team selections, among many other awards and scholarships.  Since its founding, the University of Arkansas has compiled a remarkable record of scientific, technological, intellectual and creative accomplishment. This accomplishment is exemplified by the late U.S. Senator J. William Fulbright, a Rhodes Scholar as a student and eventual president of the university (1939-41). Fulbright went on to serve at the national level, founding in 1946 the greatest international exchange program for faculty and students in the world."

            "On the sunny campus of the University of California—Irvine, students don’t have far to go to decompress after class. The Pacific Ocean is a quick 5-mile trip away, attracting surfers, sailors, and sunbathers alike. Seated in Orange County, the bustling campus is home to more than 500 student organizations, including 20 fraternities and 23 sororities. The UC-Irvine Anteaters compete at the Division I level in the Big West Conference, cheered on by non-traditional mascot Peter the Anteater and a group of student fans called Eater Nation. While UC Irvine is known as a commuter school, university officials have tried to combat that status by offering more on-campus residence options. Freshmen are not required to live on campus, but more than three fourths of first-year students choose to do so. Getting around UC Irvine is easy with the school’s ZotWheels, a fleet of blue and gold bicycles that students can pick up and ride to four campus locations. Commuters looking to be more energy efficient can carpool to campus with other students through the university’s Zimride Rideshare Community."

            "Despite its setting in Southern California, UCR has a distinctly Scottish feel. All residence halls at the University of California—Riverside are named for landmarks in Scotland, including Aberdeen-Inverness and Pentland Hills. Student athletes compete as UCR Highlanders in the NCAA Division I Big West Conference.  The school’s original mascot was a live Scottish terrier; today, sports teams are supported by a kilt-clad bear named Scotty. Members of the student Pep Band don plaid berets and sashes as they play the “Brave Scots” fight song at sports matches, and students who play the bagpipes or drums can join the school’s Pipe Band as well. More than 70 percent of UCR students are commuters, and freshmen do not have to live on campus. Students may want to hang around after class, however, for notable annual events like the fall Block Party and Spring Splash. There are more than 300 student organizations to check out, too, including about 40 fraternities and sororities. Freshmen can ease into college with the help of the First Year Success Series, a combination of seminars and workshops that teach students study and time management skills. Riverside is in an ideal location for roadtrips, with Disneyland and Orange County within a 40 mile drive and Los Angeles about 60 miles away."

Nearly 100 percent of freshmen live on campus, and choose one of 10 residential colleges to join. These small groups have their own campus locations, as well as unique architecture and programming. Kresge College, for example, houses the student-run media operations and is home to an organic garden where students can take classes; students who are members of the College Nine community are often active in volunteer efforts and the college’s Alternative Spring Break trips. Students who own RVs can also choose to reside in Camper Park, a unique community of students who live in their own home-like vehicles and share a common bathroom and lounge. Student campers may live with pre-approved roommates, including spouses. Students living in residence halls may only have overnight guests 15 times a school year, for a maximum of three nights each visit.", 
            "On campus, there are more than 25 miles of hiking and jogging trails, and more than 100 student clubs and organizations. Only about 3 percent of students are members of the school’s small Greek system. The UC Santa Cruz sports teams are independent competitors in the NCAA’s Division III. Athletes are cheered on by the Banana Slug, a nontraditional, yellow earthen creature that has been recognized among the best mascots in the country. For fun, students can tour Dead Central, a room full of Grateful Dead memorabilia donated by the band to UCSC, or explore the small beach town of Santa Cruz, located on Monterey Bay. There are rides and games on the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, and opportunities for swimming, sailing, and kayaking on the bay. To get around, students can travel on the Santa Cruz Metropolitan Transit District buses for free with school ID. For longer road trips, Monterey is 45 miles away, and San Francisco is a 75-mile trip."

            "The University of Colorado at Boulder, called CU­--Boulder for short, lays against the majestic backdrop of the Rocky Mountains. Boulder is a lively college town with more than 80 miles of biking and walking trails. In the evenings, students can travel anywhere within the city limits for free in CU NightRide shuttles, which run until 1:15 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays and 12:15 a.m. all other nights. On campus, there are more than 300 student clubs and organizations, and close to 40 fraternities and sororities. Freshmen must live on campus. The Colorado Buffaloes will compete in the NCAA Division I Pac-10 Conference starting in the fall of 2011, after a long stint in the Big 12 Conference. The student athletes, called Buffs for short, are supported by two buffalo mascots: a costumed student called Chip and a live animal named Ralphie IV. The university stresses its commitment to volunteer efforts like Better Boulder Better World, a day of community service in the surrounding neighborhoods. For trips off campus, there are 11 ski slopes within 3 hours of campus, and Rocky Mountain National Park is 45 miles away. A bit closer is Denver, the state capital, where students can catch professional sports matches or concerts in the unique outdoor concert hall, Red Rocks Amphitheatre."

            "The University of Connecticut, located in Storrs, was originally known as the Storrs Agricultural School­—a fitting name for an institution surrounded by farmland. Storrs is a sleepy town about a 30-minute drive from Hartford; 60 minutes from Providence, R.I.; and 90 minutes from Boston. Without many activities off campus, students can get involved in the 450 clubs and organizations on campus, including more than 30 fraternities and sororities. They can also catch a film in the on-campus movie theatre and skate for free in the school’s ice rink. Sports are a major focus for students; the UConn Huskies compete in the NCAA Division I Big East Conference, in which UConn’s basketball teams are especially ferocious competitors. Freshmen do not have to live on campus, though more than 70 percent of all undergraduates choose to do so. Each year before final exams, students gather for Spring Weekend, a fun-filled,  multi-day celebration that began as the school’s Campus Community Carnival in the 1940’s."

            "Founded in 1850, the University of Dayton is a top 10 national Catholic university that prepares students for success in their careers and lives. As a top-tier, comprehensive university, UD offers more than 70 academic programs in four accredited divisions - arts and sciences, business administration, education and allied professions, and engineering.\r\n\r\nAt UD, students find an environment where they are encouraged to engage the world, developing both a critical mind and a compassionate heart. Over 6,900 undergraduates call UD their home-away-from-home, and 90 percent of students live in the residence halls and porch-clad houses in the student neighborhood.\r\n\r\nGuided by a Marianist educational tradition that emphasizes building relationships, UD keeps its classes small, with an average class size of 27. In addition to hosting office hours, many professors give out their cell phone numbers and e-mail addresses so students can ask questions - and get answers - at any time.\r\n\r\nWith more than 180 clubs and organizations on campus, students will discover activities to match their interests. Students show their spirit by cheering on the Division I Flyers, and they make a difference in the world by participating in more than 30 service clubs, attending week-long BreakOut trips, hosting the annual Christmas on Campus event and more.\r\n\r\nWhether studying on campus or abroad, all University of Dayton students have the chance to receive a truly global education. UD's extensive education abroad opportunities offer programs on every continent except Antarctica. With its global perspective, the University attracts students from more than 50 countries and is ranked first in the world in an international student satisfaction survey. \r\n\r\nA vast array of internships, cooperative education and part-time employment opportunities allow UD students to earn real-world experience before earning their diploma. Ranked third among all Catholic universities for total research volume, students are also regularly hired to work with top scientists and engineers at the University of Dayton Research Institute. Employers know UD graduates have developed the skills and qualities needed to succeed, and Fortune 500 companies regularly recruit on campus.\r\n\r\nThese opportunities aren't the only value at the University of Dayton. UD is one of the most affordable private, Catholic universities in the nation - and an excellent value among comparable institutions. In fact, approximately 99 percent of incoming first-year students received some form of institutional aid (scholarships and grants) in 2008."

            "For students interested in attending the University of Delaware, it pays to live in the state. Delaware residents are given first priority when it comes to admissions, and more than 90 percent who apply will be accepted. Less than half (46 percent) of all out-of-state applicants are admitted. For all who receive admission, there are more than 280 student clubs and organizations on the school’s lush campus in downtown Newark. Nearly 20 percent of students are involved in the school’s large Greek system, which has 25 fraternities and nearly 20 sororities. The Fightin’ Blue Hens sports teams, named after a Delaware Revolutionary War battalion with the same nickname, compete in the NCAA Division I Colonial Athletic Association. The mascot is a costumed bird named YoUDee, and a group of live Blue Hen chickens reside on the school farm. Freshmen must live on campus, unless they commute from a parent’s local home. When students want to leave campus, Wilmington is 8 miles away. Philadelphia is a 45-mile drive and Baltimore is 55 miles away. The University of Delaware ran the nation’s first study abroad program in 1923, and, these days, 45 percent of undergraduates opt to spend time in another country."

            "Whether a student is looking for outdoor recreation, a bustling urban lifestyle, or a hometown team to support in every major professional sports league, he or she will likely find it at the University of Denver. Known as DU, the school is settled at the base of the Rocky Mountains in the state’s capital city. Students who want to explore Denver’s surrounding areas can join in on group trips through the school’s Alpine Club, which organizes more than 20 outdoor excursions a year. There are more than 100 other student clubs and organizations to check out, too, including about 15 fraternities and sororities. Freshmen and sophomores must live on campus unless they are older than 21. Student athletes compete on the Denver Pioneers sports teams, members of the NCAA Division I Sun Belt Conference. The school’s ski team has won more national championships than any other program in the country, and the hockey team is notoriously competitive in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association. On the professional level, Denver has a team in each of the four major sports leagues: the Denver Broncos in the NFL, the Colorado Avalanche in the NHL, the Denver Nuggets in the NBA, and the Colorado Rockies in the MLB. For creative entertainment, students can check out musical, theatrical, and innovative performances in the on-campus Newman Center. Many of the shows are free. The university campus also hosts the Pen and Podium series, which brings in several famous authors and poets to speak each year. To explore downtown Denver, students can hop on the city’s LightRail system, a network of monorail trains that stops on campus and goes to more than 30 other locations. The city is known for its revitalized urban areas, including Lower Downtown, or LoDo, a hub of shopping, dining, and nightlife that is 8 miles from campus."

            "The University of Florida is about two miles away from downtown Gainesville, a college town bolstered by the school’s nearly 50,000 students. The Florida Gators sports teams compete in the NCAA Division I Southeastern Conference, and are supported by mascots Albert and Alberta the Alligators. The Gator football team, which competes in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium—commonly called the “The Swamp”—is particularly notorious. The team became the namesake of popular sports drink Gatorade in 1966, after freshmen Gators experimented with the novel beverage. The annual Gator Growl, held each Homecoming weekend, has been called the largest student-run pep rally in the world. About 15 percent of students are involved in the school’s 60-plus fraternities and sororities. Freshmen do not have to live on campus, though about 80 percent opt to do so. All students can partake in Gator Nights, held every Friday, which offer free late-night entertainment and a free “midnight breakfast.”"

UGA’s college town of Athens was rated among the best sports towns in the country by ESPN, and the competitive Bulldogs sports teams compete in the NCAA Division I Southeastern Conference. There are more than 600 student clubs and organizations, including nearly 60 Greek chapters that involve almost 25 percent of UGA students. Community service is a particularly big focus, with student-run philanthropies such as ugaMiracle, a year-long fundraiser and 24-hour Dance Marathon for Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. Students also run the University of Georgia Insider, an online forum for advice on everything from “10 Secrets to On-Campus Survival” to “Saving Money the College Student Way.” Students must live on campus, but Atlanta is 60 miles away for those itching for a road trip."

The setting and the diversity of our students and faculty foster unique advantages in the study of Asian and Pacific cultures, foreign languages, tropical agriculture, tropical medicine, ocean and marine sciences, astronomy, volcanology, and international business.\r\n\r\nOur unique geographical, cultural, and historical heritage suggests that the University of Hawai`i at Manoa values and the responsibilities inherent in embracing those values include the following:\r\n\r\nA focus on developing an awareness of and sensitivity to diversity and commonality. The Manoa campus is culturally rich and complex, providing a perfect social setting for frequent interactions with persons from\r\ncultures other than one's own. At Manoa we incorporate and celebrate intercultural experiences and understanding into our social and educational environments in a comprehensive fashion. Manoa is also a place where historic political, economic and social conflicts between Native Hawaiian people, settlers and working immigrants have contributed to the diverse perspectives, beliefs, values and even conceptual frameworks of our islands' people. Growing out of the core Hawaiian value of aloha, an essential component of the Manoa Experience, are insights that both bond us and simultaneously express the variations that collectively enrich us.\r\n\r\nA focus on global awareness and local responsibility. These values are consistent with a uniquely Hawaiian place of learning. Hawai`i is a place where the strength of identity is important to Native Hawaiian people\r\nstruggling to maintain traditional connections while establishing new global relationships. Their struggle for cultural distinction forms a significant part of the story of human history and change. Hawai`i is also a place\r\nwhere the peoples from Asia, Europe, and the Pacific regions gathered, formed communities, and built lives together. The pluri-cultural children of Hawai`i are global citizens, a true pan-ethnic population. Hence, we attempt to \r\ninfuse our pedagogical, social, and cultural environments with a global perspective and with questions and issues of global significance. Moreover, engaging and acting upon local questions and issues during their\r\neducational experience at Manoa engenders in students a sense of responsibility toward future generations.\r\n\r\nA focus on sustainability and renewability. These values are also a reflection of our unique Hawaiian cultural history, as voiced in the Hawaiian core value of malama i ka aina, malama i ke kai (caring for the land and sea that sustain us). The Hawaiian culture teaches us to see Manoa as part of an ahupua`a extending from mountaintop to ocean, emphasizing an ecosystem understanding of our home. Hawai`i's unique geographical status as the most isolated, populated land mass on the planet makes it incumbent upon us to develop research, technologies, economy, and a way of life based on sustainability and renewability, as Polynesians did over thousands of years of voyaging, discovery and settlement. Fostering a pedagogical, social, and cultural environment that reflects these values and the knowledge developed by Native Hawaiians over the millennia is central to our efforts. Cultivating, practicing, and communicating these values are our University's gifts and obligation to the rest of the world."

            "With slightly more than 20,000 undergraduates, the University of Iowa has the smallest student population of any other school competing in the NCAA Division I Big Ten Conference. Even so, Iowa offers top-notch academic programming in more than 100 areas. Students looking to hone their leadership skills have many options, too: They can enroll in the LeaderShape Institute, a six-day getaway workshop; attend the Leadership Development Series, which meets three times a semester; or participate in the Leadership Development Conference, an annual one-day workshop. Freshmen do not have to live on campus, but more than 90 percent choose to do so. Campus life may pose a challenge to tobacco users, as Iowa is a smoke-free campus. Students have more than 500 clubs and organizations from which to choose, and close to 10 percent of students go Greek as members of the school’s 40 fraternities and sororities. Sports are another big focus of campus life; even in the competitive Big Ten, the Iowa Hawkeyes are notorious players.  Four blocks from campus is Iowa City, a Midwestern metropolis that has been recognized among the nation’s best for its scenery, greenery, and sustainable energy efforts."

            "There's no doubt the University of Louisville attracts the best and the brightest young minds to its friendly, park-like campus in the heart of Kentucky's largest city. Since 2003, 46 UofL students have won Fulbright awards, more than any other Kentucky university. This success is based in part on the fact that UofL faculty not only are some of the best in their fields, but that they take a personal interest in students and push them to do their best, too. Students at UofL are presented a wide range of study options - more than 170 fields in 11 schools and colleges - with many nationally ranked programs among them. UofL's location is also an asset, giving students many opportunities to apply the critical thinking skills they hone in the classroom to relevant, hands-on experiences in the community. UofL students benefit from superb facilities, including a library system ranked among the top 100 research libraries in North America and one of the nation's top clean rooms, where work in bioengineering, nanotechnology and other high-demand fields occurs. UofL is committed to building a nurturing and challenging intellectual climate, a respect for diversity and a genuine understanding of how diversity enriches a vibrant metropolitan research university. This includes international experience, too. One of the university's goals is to give every arts and sciences student the chance to study abroad at least once during his or her undergraduate career. The university is also one of the fastest-growing research institutions in the nation, yielding many milestone discoveries. Among other things, UofL faculty conducted the world's first successful implantation of a fully implantable artificial heart, developed the world's first effective cervical cancer vaccine and completed the nation's first successful hand transplant. Another factor that makes UofL stand out is community service. The university's curricular engagement, outreach and partnerships recently earned it a Carnegie Community Engagement ranking, a designation held by fewer than 200 institutions nationwide. In one year alone, UofL students, faculty and staff contributed more than $25.1 million to charitable organizations through volunteerism and direct donations. Among the university's many outreach programs is the Signature Partnership, working with community organizations and businesses to improve the social, cultural, educational, health care and economic development services in a historically underserved area of Louisville. UofL was environmentally minded long before \"green\" became a buzzword, co-founding the Partnership for a Green City several years ago with the city and public school system to team up on reducing waste, increasing energy efficiency and improving the health and education of area children. UofL is a major player in the downtown arts scene, too, helping bring fine arts programming to Louisville to create a more vibrant city center. The Cressman Center for the Visual Arts is just one result of this effort. It features a glass hot shop, coldworking, metal and woodworking studios and three galleries open daily to the public. But the greatest way in which UofL is making its mark is through the contributions its students make to society. They graduate to become valuable citizens such as current Republican Leader and U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell; U.S. senator and recent presidential candidate Christopher Dodd; Sirius/XM Radio personality Bob Edwards; best-selling author Sue Grafton; and Sharon Darling, founder and president of the National Center for Family Literacy. They truly help demonstrate that UofL's slogan \"It's Happening Here\" isn't just a marketing tagline - it's a way of life."

            "The University of Maine is a comprehensive public institution that is growing in international stature.  It has academic and research programs in areas such as climate change, poetry and poetics, composite materials and forest bioproducts, along with an unwavering commitment to providing a first-class experience for every student.\r\n\r\nSince its establishment in 1865, the University of Maine has served Maine and its people, offering academic programs that develop students with the necessary education and skills to live up to the state's motto, Dirigo, Latin for \"I lead.\"  From the late 19th century through today, University of Maine students, employees and graduates have been Maine's leaders in government, business, education and all other fields that have an impact on the lives of Maine's people.  Beyond its role in providing high-quality, comprehensive postsecondary education to generations of people, UMaine has embraced its responsibility to extend its expertise and resources to benefit the state.  Examples continue today through research in a wide range of relevant areas and through statewide outreach delivered by Cooperative Extension and other units.  The boundaries of UMaine are the boundaries of the state.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, UMaine is a distinctive and vital institution, serving Maine as a modern land-grant university and sea-grant college while also playing a significant role in the national context of higher education.  It is strong and dynamic, serving as the flagship university in the University of Maine System.  UMaine offers the range of programs and services befitting a comprehensive university, on a human scale where people know and care about one another.\r\n\r\nUMaine leads the way in academic research, attracting the vast majority of all federal funding that comes to Maine's institutions of publish higher education.  It is one of just 151 institutions (eight percent) nationwide to be classified by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching as a \"Research University-High Research Activity\" institution. As a by-product of research UMaine is developing new businesses.  In fact, UMaine's efforts in this area have led UMaine to a top national ranking in the number of spin-off companies per investment in university research.  \r\n\r\nThe impact of UMaine on the state's economy is dramatic.  In addition to the jobs created through its expertise and initiative, it has a total annual economic output of $698 million, adding $7.65 to the state's economy for every dollar of state investment.  It is one of the state's largest employers and has a worldwide alumni network of 95,000.\r\n\r\nWith 11.818 enrolled students, UMaine is the largest higher education institution in Maine.  Most of those students live either on campus or in close proximity, making UMaine the largest residential college community in Maine.  The home of Maine's only Division I athletic program, UMaine proudly holds two NCAA national championships in ice hockey.  Black Bears excel in the classroom as well.  In February, 258 student-athletes were honored for achieving grade point averages of 3.0 or better.\r\n\r\nStudents come from Maine, 47 other states and 84 countries. UMaine offers the state's widest variety of academic programs and its College of Liberal Arts and Sciences is the largest liberal arts institution in Maine.  With the only Phi Beta Kappa chapter at a Maine public institution, a thriving honors college and several other marks of distinction that affirm the quality of its educational program, UMaine maintains its focus on providing the kind of teaching and learning opportunities that develop graduates well-prepared to become leaders in businesses, institutions and communities.\r\n\r\nIn all it does, the University of Maine strives to prepare students for life, work, citizenship and change, while helping Maine, the nation and the world advance knowledge and address pressing needs."

            "The University of Maine at Farmington offers the educational experiences typically found at selective private colleges to bright and ambitious students from Maine and beyond. Farmington is committed to the belief that a liberal education in a residential setting is the best preparation for careers and for citizenship. Because all Farmington graduates, including those who have studied in pre-professional programs, are liberally educated, they are creative problem solvers who have learned how to learn and how to work on complex challenges with people from a variety of backgrounds and fields. \r\nThe University of Maine at Farmington offers baccalaureate programs of high quality in the arts and sciences, education, and human services. Its approach to education is based on the belief that students must have opportunities to form meaningful relationships with inspiring teachers. They must be challenged to be active citizens in a campus community that helps them find their own voices, teaches them the humility to seek wisdom from others, and prepares them for ongoing explorations of how knowledge can be put to use for the common good. \r\nEstablished in 1864 as Maine's first institution of public higher education, the University of Maine at Farmington is rooted in tradition but also values innovation. Because scholarship contributes to excellence in teaching and learning, it supports faculty, staff, and students in their scholarly and creative endeavors. As a public institution, Farmington values engagement with, and service to, the community. The University of Maine at Farmington takes pride in being an intellectual and cultural center for western Maine. \r\nIn order to achieve this mission, Farmington focuses on baccalaureate education; fosters collaborative, active learning in small classes; limits its enrollment through selective admission; invests in ongoing efforts to assess and improve teaching and learning; provides financial aid and academic support to students who need assistance; provides physical and technological accessibility; seeks out and celebrates human diversity.\r\nThe University of Maine at Farmington is located in the foothills of the Western Maine Mountains.  It is convenient to the Saddleback, Sugarloaf, and Sunday River ski areas, the Appalachian Trail, the Kennebec and Androscoggin rivers, and a variety of lakes, streams and countryside that serves as a classroom as well as place to get away and enjoy nature. \r\nOver the years, the University of Maine at Farmington has earned a national reputation for excellence, gaining stature as one of the finest state-supported universities in the northeastern United States. It is one of just 20 colleges and universities across the nation featured in Student Success in College: Creating Conditions That Matter. The book identifies schools that serve as models of educational effectiveness. Student Success in College highlights 20 high-performing institutions that create a more supportive campus culture, where students are engaged, satisfied with their post-secondary experience, and are successful. Farmington is distinguished as a college that is alive with a steady stream of innovative ideas and initiatives."

            "Located between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, the University of Maryland offers students a suburban lifestyle within easy reach of big-city experiences. The flagship campus in College Park, which has its own subway stop on the D.C.-area Metro transit system, is often considered a commuter school. Accordingly, freshmen do not have to live on campus. There are more than 500 clubs and organizations on campus, including about 35 fraternities and sororities that involve approximately 15 percent of the student population. Students looking for additional activities can visit the university’s “Free Stuff @ Maryland” website, which offers a comprehensive listing of presentations, events, and movie screenings with no admission charges. Sports also offer year-long distractions, as the Maryland Terrapins are notorious competitors in the NCAA Division I Atlantic Coast Conference. The mascot, Testudo, is a Diamondback terrapin—a species of turtle that is the official state reptile. One of several Testudo sculptures on campus sits in front of the graduate library, , and rubbing its nose is thought to bring good luck, particularly before exams."

            "The University of Mary Washington, long a highly respected and sought after institution for pursuit of academic excellence in the liberal arts, has this year added new colleges of business and education to complement its existing college of arts and sciences. Solidly grounded in the liberal arts tradition, students in all three colleges have the opportunity to work directly with professors to achieve their academic and career goals. The UMW experience is based on a culture of honor, individual recognition, and dedication to community and global service, and the university places great value on diversity within its student body. An education at UMW, with multiple opportunities for student research and service learning, prepares graduates for outstanding careers or for entry into graduate school.   A wide range of programs includes strong majors in political science and international affairs, English, biology, psychology, earth and environmental science, history, visual and performing arts, economics, and business.  Other distinctive offerings include historic preservation, a concentration in creative writing, and one of the top debate programs in the country. With its classic Jeffersonian-inspired architecture, beautifully manicured central campus walk, spacious grounds, and residential dorms located amidst traditional lecture halls, UMW truly conveys the uniquely American college experience. At the same time, renovation of heritage dorms, classrooms, performance centers, and new construction of a 624-bed residential community and 2,000-seat convocation center provide students with superb facilities. The campus is centrally located halfway between Washington, D.C. and Richmond, Va., making access to national monuments, museums, government facilities, and vibrant social scenes just a short trip away. These two capitals also serve as a rich resource for undergraduate student internships as well as a promising job market for graduates. Historic Fredericksburg, Va., the university's host city, abounds with interesting shops, great restaurants, quaint bookstores and coffee shops, all typical of the college scene and within easy walking distance from campus. One of Virginia's newest and largest modern shopping and entertainment complexes also is nearby. The campus itself is brimming with activity throughout the school year. More than 100 student organizations and clubs not only provide opportunity for leadership but also are active in arranging events for the entire student body. Whether at the new \"Underground\" snack bar and coffee house, on the lush green at Ball Circle, or at spirit rock near Campus Center, there is always something going on. UMW Eagles teams regularly compete at the championship level in NCAA Division III, and there are numerous intramural and club sporting activities available for students to compete at all levels. Getting to and from the UMW campus and around the area is easy. The local commuter bus service, FRED, serves the campus and the surrounding area, the AMTRAK station is located just downtown, and international airports in Washington D.C. and Richmond connect the university with the rest of the world. UMW students are bright, multitalented, and involved. Accomplished professors provide individualized attention to their students, and the university environment is friendly and welcoming."

            "The University of Massachusetts Amherst combines the academic resources of a nationally ranked research university with the support and individualized attention usually reserved for a small college. Students come from every state and over 100 countries, making this New England campus a national and international center for intellectual and cultural activity. With over 85 majors, UMass Amherst offers its students a wide array of academic disciplines and nationally known programs of study, including the Bachelor's Degree with Individual Concentration (BDIC), which allows students to create their own major. (If you are a legal resident of Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island or Vermont, and the major you want at UMass Amherst is not available at your public college, you may qualify for reduced tuition through the New England Regional Student Program.) The outstanding full-time faculty of over 1,100 are the best in their fields and they take teaching seriously. Students complement their classroom work with internships, co-ops and research, working side-by-side their faculty. Students take what they learn in the classroom, and apply it in the studio, the lab, the concert hall and the field. With this intersection of learning and doing, students find their intellectual voice and independence. Commonwealth Honors College, the honors program, welcomes students who seek additional academic challenge and meet the requirements for acceptance. The extensive library system is the largest at any public institution in the Northeast, and offers students a state-of-the-art learning environment through the Learning Commons, a place that fosters academic collaboration and social interaction. Through the Five College Interchange, students enroll in classes at nearby Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, and Smith Colleges at no extra charge. A fare-free bus system connects these five campuses, allowing students to participate in a wide array of social and cultural events. UMass Amherst first-year students participate in the Residential First Year Experience, choosing a living option based on themes and shared interests. Living and learning together, students take field trips, organize events and interact with faculty and staff.  Other opportunities for personal development are found through the Center for Student Development, which brings together more than 200 clubs and organizations; groups include community service organizations, student government, ethnic and cultural groups, religious and spiritual organizations, fraternity and sororities, student run businesses, media related groups, groups that grow from academic interests, and groups dedicated to athletics and recreation, socializing, arts and entertainment, and politics. UMass Amherst competes in NCAA Division I Intercollegiate Athletics. Students attend every home game free in regular season, and wear their Minutemen and Minutewomen maroon proudly. Any student who enjoys athletic competition can participate in an extensive intramural sports program which supports the athletic interests of 5,000 students. The new Recreation Center boasts 2 floors of weights and fitness areas, a 3 court gymnasium, jogging track and juice bar.  Just off campus, the picturesque Town of Amherst offers scores of shops and restaurants from Mexican or Thai, to pizza, burgers and Indian. Appearing on the top ten lists for college towns, Amherst has a truly unusual combination of New England charm and international sophistication. Boston is less than two hours away, and New York City just three hours south. For outdoor enthusiasts, the mountains of Vermont are less than an hour away and offer skiing and hiking. Maybe you can't have it all, but the  University of Massachusetts Amherst certainly comes close. Please see http://www.umass.edu/admissions"

Minneapolis and St. Paul, known as the Twin Cities, are frequently recognized for sports, cleanliness, and volunteerism. The school stretches across the Twin Cities with a campus in each, though the Minneapolis site is considered the main campus of the University of Minnesota. Freshmen do not have to live on campus, but the 75 percent who choose to can opt to live in a traditional residence hall or one of 24 Living Learning communities, such as the Healthy Foods, Healthy Lives House, and the La Casa De Español. Also on campus are more than 600 student organizations, including nearly 40 fraternities and sororities. The Minnesota Golden Gophers compete in the Big Ten, and all athletic events are held in the Minneapolis campus’s Stadium Village neighborhood. Goldy Gopher, the school mascot, energizes thousands of student fans as they chant “Ski-U-Mah,” a rally cry that means “Victory UM.” Under the Four-Year Graduation Plan, the university ensures that all necessary classes will be available for a student to complete their degree on time. If courses are not available in an undergraduate’s four years of schooling, the university will pay for the extra credits."

            "Founded in 1848, The University of Mississippi is a public, comprehensive, research institution that offers what many have called the ideal educational experience. With just under 14,500 students on our beautifully landscaped Oxford campus (over 18,000 including our Medical Center in Jackson and other locations), the university brings together the best that a public university offers while still providing the qualities most often found at expensive private colleges. Professors teach students in small classes that often average 40 or less. More importantly, we have an impressive track record of success in student outcomes. In the past seven years, 100 percent of the graduates of our accountancy and pharmacy graduate programs landed jobs; undergraduates were accepted to medical school at a rate nearly twice the national average; and 93 percent of graduating students ranked their educational experience as excellent or good. Our research programs in acoustics, atmospheric physics, health care, remote sensing, Southern studies, space law and pharmaceutical sciences are not only renowned internationally but also delivering real-world solutions to problems faced by our state, nation and world. Our Croft Institute for International Studies, Lott Leadership Institute and Sally McDonnell Barksdale Honors College are unsurpassed at even the Ivy League schools.  On the Oxford campus, the University offers more than 100 majors in the College of Liberal Arts and professional schools of Accountancy, Applied Sciences, Business, Education, Engineering, Journalism, Pharmacy and Law. The Academic Support Center helps students without declared majors and supports students in health professions programs and pre-professional tracks. Outside the classroom, students can choose to get involved in more than 250 student organizations, including service, student government, honorary, professional, Greek, religious, visual and performing arts, political, special interest and international. They attend lectures by renowned speakers and enjoy world-class musical and theatrical performances at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts. Students also run a daily newspaper, radio and TV station, and they like to participate in sports and recreation. Offerings include a fitness center and classes, natatorium, intramurals and sports clubs, newly renovated golf course and a 10-acre outdoor sports complex with zip lining and wall climbing. They also go on skiing, hiking, rafting and other adventure trips sponsored by Ole Miss Outdoors. Health services, physical therapy, counseling services and around-the-clock crisis services are available to students, and for off-campus entertainment, the downtown Oxford Square is a popular destination for shopping, dining and live music.  The University of Mississippi ranks among the safest college campuses in the nation. It is ranked No. 9 on a list of America's safest college campuses published by dailybeast.com, a nonpartisan news aggregation Web site. The site based the rankings on an analysis of crime statistics submitted to the U.S. Department of Education by 4,000 four-year colleges and universities with more than 6,000 students. UM also was ranked by StateUniversity.com as the safest Southeastern Conference campus. StateUniversity.com compared crime statistics for more than 450 colleges and universities nationwide. These rankings reflect open communication between the University Police Department and local law enforcement agencies, as well as such programs as Adopt-a-Cop, where UPD officers serve as liaisons with various student organizations, Rebel Patrol, which provides on-campus escorts for anyone concerned about walking alone on campus, and ???Code Blue??? phones, which put students in immediate contact with police for assistance with any emergency."

            "Students at the University of Missouri live in a unique botanical garden, with more than 40,000 plants across campus. More than a third of high school seniors from Missouri attend Mizzou each year, and all freshmen must live on campus. As the only Division I-A sports school in the state, the Missouri Tigers teams are a big focus of campus life. The teams compete in the NCAA Division I Big 12 Conference and are particularly competitive in football. The school mascot, Truman the Tiger, is named after former President Harry Truman, who was born in Missouri. Mizzou has more than 600 clubs and organizations for students. More than 20 percent of students join the school’s Greek system, which comprises 50-plus fraternities and sororities. Students also have a vast array of degree options, with more than 280 majors, nearly 50 of which can be completed online. The university’s hometown of Columbia is in central Missouri and is host to annual events like the Roots ’n Blues ’n BBQ music festival and Art in the Park, a large creative works showcase. To travel around campus and the town on the weekends, students have free access to STRIPES, a transportation service that delivers riders to their destinations from 10 p.m. to  3 a.m. Thursday through Sunday."

In the university's early days, renowned educator and administrator Charles Bessey wrote the language for the Hatch Act which on a national scale helped define land-grant and extension services missions, and firmly placed Nebraska among universities whose mission is to do 'practical' research and outreach.  But Nebraska also maintains a solid mission for teaching and for research in the arts and sciences, pointing us toward the traditional AAU philosophy.  The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is the state's comprehensive research university."

            "According to the school, the University of North Carolina Wilmington is unique among public comprehensive universities because it offers effective learning environments for undergraduates that integrate teaching and mentoring with research and service at a level that rivals exclusive research institutions of similar size. Students consistently praise the quality of interactions with UNCW's world-class faculty and express strong satisfaction with their overall educational experience. UNCW's strength in the natural sciences, especially biological sciences, chemistry, geological sciences and other disciplines that form the core of our internationally respected niche in marine science, is the result of decades of intentional focus and investment and our coastal environment is ideal for hands-on research. In the arts and literature, UNCW's high profile programs are film studies and creative writing. The Department of Film Studies takes advantage UNCW's location in Wilmington, N.C., the home of Screen Gems Studios, the largest full-service motion picture facility in the United States east of California. The department has evolved from a few film-related courses in various departments to one of the most popular majors on campus. The Master of Fine Arts in creative writing was designated one of the top 50 creative writing programs in the nation in the Nov./Dec. 2009 issue of Poets & Writers Magazine. One of the top publications in the profession, Poets & Writers ranks UNCW's program fifth in creative nonfiction. Degree programs in the School of Nursing, Watson School of Education and Cameron School of Business are designed specifically to serve professional workforce needs in the region. The College of Arts and Sciences stresses applied learning experiences across the liberal arts disciplines to prepare its students to bridge the gap between the classroom and the complex problems of 21st century communities. Due to its location near the large military installations of Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune and New River Air Station in Jacksonville, NC, UNCW is focused on providing access to higher education and ongoing support to retired and active duty military personnel and their dependents. The university's efforts to integrate military-affiliated students into campus life have been cited as a model at the state and national level. UNCW's commitment to veteran students recently earned it a top spot on GI Jobs magazine's ranking of the national most military friendly colleges and universities. UNCW also has an institutional commitment to instill in its students a strong sense of civic responsibility and volunteerism. More than 4,700 students contributed more than 51,000 hours to volunteer and service learning projects in 2009. The economic value of that community service exceeds $1 million. Also for 2009, the university was recognized by the Peace Corps as one of the top 25 medium-sized schools in the nation for producing Peace Corps volunteers."

            "The University of Oklahoma is truly an extraordinary institution, known for its academic excellence and strong sense of community.   Attracting top students from across the nation and more than 100 countries around the world, OU provides a major university experience in a private college atmosphere. OU is number one in the nation in the number of National Merit Scholars enrolled per capita among public universities. The OU Honors College is one of the largest honors programs among public universities in the United States, matching the University's best and brightest students with faculty in classrooms of 19 or fewer students. OU is one of the few public universities in the nation to cap the class size of first-year English composition courses at no more than 19. The University is first in the Big 12 and at the top in the nation in international exchange agreements with countries around the world with 174 student exchange agreements with universities in 66 countries. The number of endowed faculty positions has grown more than five-fold since 1994, increasing from less than 100 to 539 today, helping to retain and attract talented faculty members.   Just one year after launching a five-year Campaign for Scholarship endowments, we reached our goal of raising $50 million, allowing the university to award hundreds of new scholarships and ensuring that OU will remain affordable and keep open the door of opportunity for all qualified students. Because the need for scholarships remains high, the campaign goal was increased to $100 million to be raised by September 2009.  During the past decade, research expenditures have more than doubled at OU. OU ended fiscal year 2008 with total research expenditures of more than $275 million. Since 1995, almost $1.5 billion in construction projects have been completed, are under way or are forthcoming on OU's three campuses.  OU is extraordinary, too, because of its excellent programs and resources. OU's two public museums, the Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art and the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History, rank among the top university-based museums in the country. OU's Bizzell Memorial Library features the largest history of science collection in the world, and is the only place in the United States where you can hold a book with Galileo's handwriting in your own hands.  There is a true sense of family on the OU campus. Serving as a model for other public universities, OU established the Faculty-In-Residence program which places faculty members and their families in each of our residence halls to foster faculty and student interaction and encourage intergenerational friendships. Further, a different professor adopts each floor of the residence halls as well as each fraternity and sorority, allowing students and faculty to build relationships outside of the classroom."

            "One of only 62 institutions in the prestigious Association of American Universities, the University of Oregon is the flagship institution of the Oregon University System. Academic quality is the cornerstone of the University of Oregon's identity as a public research university. Beginning in their freshman year, students take courses from faculty who are leaders in their respective fields, have opportunities to be involved in cutting-edge research in every academic discipline, and work alongside prominent scholars, assisting with their work as well as conducting original research of their own. Freshmen have the option to enroll in over 50 different Freshman Interest Groups, special course groupings in which small groups of first-year students take two core courses that are connected through a third seminar course. In addition, Freshman Seminar classes allow students to explore topics in-depth with some of Oregon's most prominent faculty members. Highly motivated students find opportunities for intellectual challenge in the Robert Clark Honors College, the Society of College Scholars within the College of Arts and Sciences, or Research and Honors programs within individual departments. Distinctive opportunities include the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center and the Lundquist Center for Entrepreneurship within the Lundquist College of Business; the Green Chemistry Laboratory and the Alice C. Tyler Instrumentation Center, the first green chemistry facilities of their kind in the nation; the Lorry I. Lokey Laboratories building that is encased in bedrock nineteen feet below the ground, providing an optimal setting for nanoscience research; extensive opportunities for overseas study and internships; and Future Music Oregon, a center in the School of Music that explores sound and its composition through the innovative use of computers and new technologies. At the University of Oregon, more than 22,000 men and women study in idyllic, lush settings in the heart of the rugged Pacific Northwest where the dramatic Oregon coast is an hour's drive to the west, and the Cascade Mountains are an hour to the east, allowing easy access to both winter and summer sports and activities. The university's mid-range size gives it the ambience of a smaller institution, but with the benefit of the resources of a major research institution. The University of Oregon's 295-acre main campus is located in Eugene, nationally recognized as one of America's most livable cities, as well as one of its best college towns. The university is a community of scholars dedicated to the highest standards of academic inquiry, learning, and service who recognize that knowledge is the fundamental wealth of civilization. Students come to Oregon because they find faculty and fellow students who share their belief that education should inspire and prepare people to make a difference in the world. The University of Oregon is a unique institution that will challenge students to change the world by giving them the skills and knowledge to question critically, think logically, communicate clearly, act creatively, and live ethically."

            "Located in the Oakwood neighborhood, Pitt’s campus is a 3-mile trip from bustling downtown Pittsburgh. The city is home to powerhouse professional sports teams, such as the Steelers and Penguins, and dozens of unique cultural centers, like the Andy Warhol Museum and Phipps Conservatory & Botanical Gardens. Pitt students get free admission to these and other select museums throughout the school year. Because Pittsburgh is bordered by three rivers, kayaking, sailing, and fishing opportunities are plentiful. City buses stop every 10 to 15 minutes on campus, and students can ride public transportation into the city for free with school ID. Freshmen do not have to live on campus. Pitt has a sizeable Greek community of about 35 fraternities and sororities. Students in Arts and Sciences majors can earn hands-on credits in internships, research, and teaching with the help of the university’s Office of Experiential Learning. The Pittsburgh Panthers sports teams compete in the NCAA Division I Big East Conference. Pitt students are notorious for their avid support at sporting events, particularly for forming a riotous cheering section known as the Oakland Zoo at basketball games. Students who attend the most home sporting events get priority purchasing when game tickets are in high demand through the school’s Loyalty Points system."

            "The University of Portland, Oregon's Catholic university, has received several national faculty awards from the Carnegie Foundation in recent years, among them the U.S. Professor of the Year (2000) and three Oregon Professor of the Year honors. Its faculty and students have earned many Fulbright, Marshall, Mitchell, and Goldwater fellowships, and have received both the Oregon's Governor's Award for more than 10,000 hours of volunteer service annually and Washington Monthly magazine's national top ranking for service to the nation. The University is renowned for its extensive study-abroad programs (in Asia, Australia, Latin America, and Europe), its award-winning cross-disciplinary entrepreneurship program, its innovative education, biology, and theater programs, its state-of-the-art nursing and science laboratories, and its booming global business and environmental ethics majors-- the latter the only one of its kind in the U.S. The University also sponsors a creative center for freshman support, savors its NCAA national champion women's soccer team (twice in four years), and has been dedicated for more than a century to creating a campus community where 'teachable moments' in and out of the classroom are not only prized but the true epiphanies sparking lifelong learning."

            "Virginia’s capital city of Richmond is a historic one, packed with parks, culture, nightlife, and opportunities for outdoor recreation, so students at the university of the same name won’t likely be bored. University of Richmond students can go white water rafting on the nearby James River, or can stop by some of the city’s many events throughout the year, such as  the Richmond Folk Festival and the Richmond Greek Festival. There are a handful of popular music venues downtown, as well as scores of restaurants, bars, and clubs. On the University of Richmond campus, one-third of the student body is involved in the Greek system, comprising about 15 fraternities and sororities. If Greek life isn’t your thing, there are more than 250 other student clubs and organizations to check out, too. First-year students must live on campus, and can elect to live in specialty housing programs. The all-male RC Xtreme group is ideal for freshmen who want to go on weekend adventure trips with their floormates, and female students can live and learn through programs like Ready for Moore, a residence hall community aimed at enhancing leadership skills. Campus housing is a popular option for students of all years, as more than 90 percent of undergraduates choose to live in residence halls. The University of Richmond is the only school in the country to use a spider as its unique mascot, and all Spiders athletic teams compete in the NCAA Division I Atlantic 10 Conference, except for football and women’s golf. Those teams are members of the Colonial Athletic Association. Student fans in the Richmond Rowdies spirit club cheer on the athletes—especially the competitive Spider basketball and football teams. The university offers 75 study abroad programs, and more than half of all students take part in a global opportunity before graduation."

            "The University of San Diego is a Roman Catholic institution open to students of all faiths. As its name suggests, the school overlooks the San Diego Bay, and the city of San Diego is a 15-minute trip away. On campus, there are more than 100 student organizations, including about 10 fraternities and sororities. Most of the San Diego Torero sports teams are members of the NCAA Division I West Coast Conference; the football team competes in the NCAA Division I-AA Pioneer League. Athletic teams are cheered on by the school’s mascot, a costumed bullfighter named Diego Torero. As a Roman Catholic institution, the University Ministry coordinates retreats and immersion trips and hosts daily mass services, including a special Mass for Peace on Wednesday nights. After class, students can relax at nearby beaches, like La Jolla and Pacific Beach, or explore Balboa Park, the biggest urban cultural park in the country that includes  15 museums, the San Diego Zoo, and the Old Globe Theatre. Opportunities to kayak, sail, wind surf, and more are nearby. Students can join group excursions, led by the school’s Experiential Learning and Adventure Center, or rent kayaks, surfboards, and snorkel equipment on campus for trips on their own. Freshmen must live on campus, and for students around on the weekends, the school hosts a Friday Night Movies series and Saturday Night Live Concert series."

Like the best private liberal arts colleges, USAO offers small classes, highly qualified faculty committed to teaching (90 percent have terminal degrees), nationally ranked teams in five sports, and a campus culture that fosters close faculty-student interaction and undergraduate research opportunities.  Founded in 1908 as a public liberal arts college for women and made coeducational in 1965, its mission has never changed, thus making it one of the oldest state-supported liberal arts colleges in the nation. USAO is a proud member of the exclusive, national Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges.  Because of its special qualities, the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education charged USAO in 2005 to raise its admission standards to the highest in the state system.

            "The University of St. Francis in Joliet, Ill., is committed to quality, to students, to community and the Franciscan values of Respect, Integrity, Compassion and Service. The success of students as individuals is paramount at USF. The university's mission is to educate the spirit as well as the mind, and to help students fulfill their dreams. The years spent at USF, whether as an undergraduate on-campus student, an off-campus student, a graduate or online students, are a time of growth, spiritually, personally and intellectually.\r\n\r\nThe University of St. Francis is ranked in the top tier of U.S. News & World Report's \"America's Best Colleges,\" and appears in the top tier of Midwestern master's colleges and universities. The Princeton Review has also named USF in \"Best Colleges, Region by Region.\"\r\n\r\nUSF is dedicated through its Catholic Franciscan mission to educating the whole of a person, and instilling the value of lifelong learning.  USF prepares students with and for real-world experience.  The university provides quality educational opportunities through innovative delivery services, reaffirming the ideal through programming offered nationwide that a liberal education provides the comprehensive cultural background necessary for every profession.  Academic excellence is the focus at every level of the education process.\r\n\r\nIn fall 2009, USF moved its Art & Design Department to new facilities in the historic Rialto Square Theater in downtown Joliet to provide students with an urban experience in state-of-the-art academic facilities. Another example of how the University of St. Francis lives its values is its Health and Wellness Center, the first nurse-managed center in Will County. While advanced nurse practitioners on the university's faculty manage and staff the center, students are drawn to academic coursework, service and to real-life experience from the areas of Nursing and Allied Health, Business, Recreation, Sports and Tourism Management and Social Work, among others. This unique learning and service opportunity is just one of the many benefits to the university's learning-centered approach to education: the student Mock Trial Team has placed nationally; the television station produces a weekly cable television show; and the radio station offers a variety of programming, all planned and produced by students. The Duns Scotus honor society offers a variety of special learning and service opportunities. Learning is enhanced with study abroad experiences. Mission trips to Bolivia and areas within the United States are offered as part of the educational experience.\r\n\r\nUSF is a national leader in offering educational opportunities to working health care professionals, with more than 42,000 alumni nationwide. The master's degree in Physician Assistant Studies is offered at USF's Albuquerque, N.M. site to prepare health care providers for the traditionally underserved Southwest area of the country.\r\n\r\nThe University of St. Francis was among the first higher education institutions to offer its MBA completely online. USF has a more than 35 years experience serving adult learners with innovative programming and course delivery.\r\n\r\nFrom summer art and basketball camps for grade school students to programs for senior citizens, USF actively promotes learning. As an urban university located in one of the fastest growing regions in the country, USF reaches to a diverse constituency, serving as a cultural, social, spiritual and intellectual center for the community and as a resource and partner for business and industry.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1920, the University of St. Francis offers more than 60 areas of undergraduate study in arts and sciences, business, education, nursing and allied health and social work, including four degree-completion programs. Thirteen graduate programs are offered in business, education and health care. The institution serves some 3,600 students throughout the country and has more than 42,000 alumni."

            "Ensuring access so all qualified students can attend the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and helping students reach their full potential is the foundation of UT's strategic mission. Exposing students to experiences and educational opportunities that best prepare them for working in a global marketplace is a primary focus. \r\n\r\nUT enrolled 27,739 total students for the 2008-09 academic year, with a freshmen class of 4,215. The 2008-09 freshmen had an average GPA of 3.65 with an average ACT score of 27. ACT scores have risen steadily since the Tennessee Hope lottery-funded scholarship began in 2004. About 99 percent of the in-state freshman class qualify for the Hope Scholarship, which provides $4,000 per year. Forty percent of that same class receives some additional need- or merit-based aid. \r\n\r\nThe University has created three need-based scholarship and grant programs to allow greater access to all academically qualified Tennessee students. The Tennessee Pledge Scholarship program covers tuition, fees, and room and board for eligible low-income students. The Tennessee Promise Scholarship program provides scholarships to students from select state high schools that traditionally have not sent many students to UT. Next fall, a new admissions initiative called Achieve the Dream program will make grant money available to help students from lower middle-income families. \r\n\r\nFifteen of the nation's top students will enter UT in the fall of 2009 as the second class of Haslam Scholars, a preeminent honors program that includes a study-abroad opportunity and up to $5,500 for a senior research thesis. Additionally, in recent years, UT Knoxville has enrolled three Goldwater Scholars, one Goldwater Honorable Mention, a Fulbright scholar, and a Udall Scholar. \r\n\r\nUT's long-range program \"Ready for the World\" continues to help students gain the international and intercultural knowledge they need to succeed in today's world. The effort has enriched campus multicultural programming and has provided new scholarships and study-abroad opportunities.\r\n\r\nGraduate and undergraduate education are both enhanced by UT's partnership with Battelle to manage nearby Oak Ridge National Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. That relationship helps UT recruit top scientists and offer first-rate internships and research opportunities.\r\n\r\nUT Knoxville's faculty has an impressive list of honors in the past few years: For 2009, those include a Fulbright Scholar, A Guggenheim Fellow and two NEH fellows. UT Knoxville is tied with the University of Virginia with the sixth most NEH fellows in the U.S. over the past five years. \r\n\r\nUT has launched many new initiatives to help students succeed and graduate on time. The Student Success Center, which opened in 2005, provides information and resources in academic advising, tutoring, and academic support.\r\nA new program, UT LEAD, started in 2008 with a five-week summer institute that continues during the school year with academic counseling, first-year seminars, leadership development programs, academic success workshops and other learning opportunities. \r\n\r\nUT Knoxville has 11 colleges and more than 300 degree programs. The University is adjacent to Knoxville's redeveloped downtown which offers theater, cinema, and concerts. The nation's most visited national park, The Great Smoky Mountains National Park, is just minutes from campus."

            "For more than 100 years, University of the Cumberlands has been committed to challenging students with an innovative education while remaining keenly aware of the importance of traditional liberal arts education.  Our commitment to traditional values is reflected by our undergraduate curriculum which provides the foundation for a deeper understanding of advanced studies.  Cumberland graduates enjoy a high acceptance rate to graduate and professional schools.  Within five years of graduation, 66% of our alums have completed or are pursuing a graduate or professional degree.  Of course, one of the major reasons for the success of our students is that we require more than just academic success for their degree.  We also require that each student help his/her fellowman by volunteering a minimum of 40 hours of community service hours before graduation.  The Leadership and Community Service Program helps us to fulfill our mission of preparing students for lives of ethical and responsible leadership. Through this program, students gain practical hands-on experience working with established service organizations and designing and implementing community service projects.  We have found that once the students catch the spirit of volunteerism, the majority will exceed the requirement.  For instance, since we began our Community Service program eleven years ago, our students have volunteered 375,174 hours.  This equates to 180 years of community service (at 40 hours per week) for a total of $2,194,767 (at minimum wage).  What a difference these youngsters have made in the lives of so many!"

            "Students at the University of Tulsa leave with two transcripts: an academic one and a co-curricular one. The CCT, as the latter is known, is a log of all membership in clubs, any leadership positions, and any marketable skills a student has gained while in college. To beef up a CCT, students can get involved in more than 200 student clubs and organizations. The school’s Greek system has more than 10 fraternities and sororities. Freshmen and sophomores must live on campus, unless they commute from a parent’s home within 20 miles of campus. Students who are at least 21 years old or married may live off campus, too. The Golden Hurricane sports teams are members of the Division I Conference USA, and the school’s mascot is a superhero named Captain Cane. At the end of select weeks during the year, students can join for Hurricane Thursdays, campus celebrations which alternate between carnivals, concerts, and more. The TU campus is two miles away from downtown Tulsa, Okla., a city of about half a million people that is home to performing arts centers, museums, shops, and night clubs. The state capital of Oklahoma City is about 100 miles away."

Students who want to take advantage of the surrounding nature in Burlington, Vt., can rent skis, snowshoes, canoes, and camping equipment on campus. Students don’t have to go far for an adventure, though; UVM has an adventure ropes course and an indoor rock climbing wall. There are more than 150 student organizations on campus, including about 20 fraternities and sororities. Fewer than 10 percent of students go Greek. Freshmen and sophomores must live on campus. The Catamounts athletic teams compete in the NCAA Division I America East Conference, cheered on  by a mountain cat mascot named Rally. In Burlington, students can explore the outdoor Church Street Marketplace, a collection of restaurants and boutiques, or relax on the shores of Lake Champlain. For a more urban experience, Montreal and Boston are about 100 and 220 miles away, respectively."

For those that do reside in the residence halls, the university stresses “living green” through energy conservation and recycling. On the sports fields, the school’s varsity athletes are competitive in the NCAA Division I Pacific-10 Conference. The football team, in particular, is a traditional league stand-out. The teams are represented by two mascots: one, a costumed student known as Harry the Husky Dawg, and the other, Dubs, a live Alaskan husky. The university gym is free for students seeking a workout."

We are a leader among comprehensive universities in the number of chemistry graduates earning Ph.D.s. We graduate more physics and chemistry majors than most colleges in the nation, according to the American Institute of Physics and the American Chemical Society. A senior majoring in biochemistry and molecular biology was named a 2010 Truman Scholar by the Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation. Just 60 students in the nation received the Truman awards, which provide up to $30,000 for graduate study. We're one of four undergraduate institutions in the nation to have four or more Dreyfus teacher-scholar winners on its faculty. Several science and math faculty have received large grant awards from the National Science Foundation, and history and education faculty have secured U.S. Department of Education grants. Our nationally recognized undergraduate student-faculty research program provides research opportunities often available only to graduate students at large schools. Hundreds of students in many disciplines conduct research with faculty. Research often is published in prestigious journals, such as the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Undergraduate students sometimes are lead authors on the published articles. Our music program features faculty and students who perform worldwide, with venues ranging from Carnegie Hall to the Vatican. Jazz Ensemble I again won a Down Beat Award for Best College Jazz Enssemble. The award is the highest possible award a college jazz program can attain. This is the sixth time the ensemble has won the prestigious national award. We offer many programs that allow students to study, live and work in international settings, as well as programs that bring international students here. We send more students abroad than any other master's level institution in Wisconsin. Almost 25 percent of our students study abroad in more than 30 countries. A growing number of education students complete their student teaching in international settings. An increasing number of students earn scholarships through competitive programs to study and conduct research abroad. More students are completing internships in international settings. Students also are having meaningful experiences at sites within the United States, with activities ranging from civil rights pilgrimages to the south to volunteer work in tribal schools in northern Wisconsin to research in western mountain ranges. UW-Eau Claire is the only public university in north western and north central Wisconsin that offers a baccalaureate nursing degree. The program graduates more than 100 students a year. The university is one of just a handful of public regional universities in the nation-the only one in Wisconsin-to include service-learning as a graduation requirement. Each year our students provide nearly 470,000 hours in community service. UW-Eau Claire was again named in the President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll with Distinction for General Community Service. We're the only Wisconsin school named to the Honor Roll with distinction all four years it has existed.  UW-Eau Claire is a signatory to the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment. Our athletics department is ranked 13th best in the nation out of 420 schools, based on the number of teams advancing to the NCAA tournament."

We are one of the few schools to adopt effective assessment tools for the program.  As a wireless and wired campus, 90 percent of our classrooms are modern, mediated learning centers, and we are committed to using modern technology for all education and business functions.  Lab-based experiences are provided for the majority of students in all programs.  UW-Stout was officially designated Wisconsin's Polytechnic University by the Board of Regents in March 2007.  This initiative is simply the natural outgrowth of our historic tradition.  The designation guides UW-Stout when adding degree programs; it elevates the already excellent reputation the university has with business and industry; it increases national recognition which means more opportunities for research and partnerships with business and industry; and it builds on UW-Stout's already exceptional placement rate providing excellent co-op, internship and job opportunities."

            "A highly selective, independent, nondenominational coed liberal arts college of 1,700 students in suburban Philadelphia, Ursinus is nationally recognized for fostering undergraduate research through one-on-one relationships with faculty, internship and study abroad programs, and a core curriculum that includes the Common Intellectual Experience for first-year students.  With an outstanding record of placing students in graduate, law and medical schools, Ursinus is one of only 50 colleges nationwide whose seniors may compete for Watson fellowships; one of a handful of colleges highlighted in a book about the National Survey of Student Engagement's Project DEEP (Documenting Effective Educational Practices), and one of 10 founding institutional members of Project Pericles, which works to fosters civic and social engagement among college students nationwide.  Ursinus competes in Division III athletics in the prestigious Centennial Conference, along with Bryn Mawr, Franklin & Marshall, Haverford, Johns Hopkins and Swarthmore. In recent years, new majors in Neuroscience, Biochemistry, and Theater and Dance and the opening of a new performing arts center have enhanced the curricular offerings of the college. The college's relatively new Environmental Studies major is also gaining prominence as partnerships among the college and organizations seeking to improve local ecosystems become more extensive."

            "Located in Lexington, Va., the Virginia Military Institute is the oldest state-supported military college in the United States. Students admitted to the college are known as military cadets and are required to participate in the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC). Unlike the federal service academies, Virginia Military Institute cadets are not required to serve in the military upon graduation. Cadets have about 80 academic, professional, and social clubs and organizations to choose from upon entering the college. Freshmen admitted to the Institute are immediately exposed to the Ratline, which is a system designed to remove wealth and former status in life to create equality among all cadets. This is done through a series of team-building exercises as well as with the assistance of upperclassmen. The housing situation is much different from most universities’ campuses. Known as the Barracks, cadets live modestly, with limited space and multiple occupants, and are expected to maintain cleanliness and order at all times. The Virginia Military Institute Keydets fields 14 NCAADivision I athletic programs and is a member of the Big South Conference, Southern Conference, and Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference."

            "At Virginia Tech, a former military institute with its background in the sciences, students are encouraged to “invent the future.” Students are known as Hokies, a term that was the original rally cry when the school was known as the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute. Sports teams, also known as the Hokies, compete in the NCAA Division I Atlantic Coast Conference, and the school mascot is the HokieBird. Virginia Tech is settled in Blacksburg, a typical college town full of restaurants, bars, and clubs. Students account for more than half the total residents in Blacksburg, and they dominate the town’s public Blacksburg Transit bus system, which is free for Hokies. On campus, students can go bowling, play pool, or try out video games in the BreakZONE, sponsored by the Department of University Unions and Student Activities. There are also more than 600 clubs and organizations, including a large Greek system of approximately 65 fraternities and sororities. Freshmen must live on campus, which puts them in close proximity to the school’s renowned dining facilities. Students can order steak and lobster at Virginia Tech’s West End Market, or grab a meal from on-campus chain restaurants including Au Bon Pain and Sbarro."

            "As one of three remaining all-men’s liberal arts colleges in the country, Wabash College is a minority. This is also one of its biggest selling points, as the college insists this aspect of the school promotes intense focus on academics. At the college, nearly 40 percent of the student body competes in varsity sports and more than 80 percent participates in intramural or club sports. Known as the Little Giants, Wabash is a member of the North Coast Athletic Conference in the NCAA Division III. With an enrollment of fewer than 1,000 students, the college promotes cohesion among the student body and requires that students live on campus during their first two years at the school. Greek life is very popular and about half of the students participate in the fraternity program. Those looking for programs and activities outside of athletics and Greek life can choose from the more than 60 on-campus organizations, ranging from national service organizations to debate clubs. Students hoping to experience a larger city are only an hour outside of Indianapolis, the largest city in Indiana and its state capital."

            "\"Sustaining the Innovation.\" At Wagner College we believe education is about connecting.  Connected learning comes through linking multidisciplinary classes (learning communities), experiential learning, civic education and a strong focus on writing and communication.  The \"Wagner Plan\" requires that each student take three learning communities.  In the first semester the \"LC\" connects two required courses around a theme, adds a writing intensive Reflective Tutorial and includes three hours per week of community based fieldwork related to the courses.  In the senior year a capstone LC in the major, includes 100 hours of fieldwork and a thesis/research project.  The 3rd LC is taken in the middle years and combines the major with core requirements.  Our curriculum has been lauded by AAC&U, The Washington Center for Learning and Time Magazine among others.  At Wagner students truly \"learn by doing\"."

            "Washington & Jefferson College offers an exceptional liberal arts education. W&J has been ranked first in the country per capita for producing attorneys and third in the country for producing physicians and medical researchers. Routinely, 90% of our applicants to medical and law schools are admitted. In 2007, 100% of W&J graduates passed the Pennsylvania bar exam. More than 85% of seniors seeking employment find work in their fields or admission to graduate school before graduation.\r\n\r\nW&J offers students a personalized learning experience, with more than 70% of classes having fewer than 20 students. With a 12:1 student-to-faculty ratio, professors hold classes in their homes, help students develop advanced research agendas, and attend athletic events to cheer them on.  In addition, numerous alumni around the world offer students networking opportunities in nearly every discipline.\r\n\r\nThe result is student achievement of the highest caliber. Our students land research internships at The Pasteur Institute, The Mayo Clinic, and Los Alamos Labs, to name a few. W&J challenges our students by sending them to national meetings where their research is presented alongside that of professional researchers, graduate students, and faculty from other institutions. \r\n\r\nMore than half of our students take advantage of more than 40 study abroad programs in countries such as Australia, China, France, Germany, Spain, and South Africa. W&J students put their liberal arts educations to work, testing their professional aspirations in the real world while becoming global citizens.\r\n\r\nThe Intersession term, a distinctive feature of our 4-1-4 academic calendar, allows students to take one course, intensively, during the month of January. They may travel to London to study theatre, camp out in Africa to watch animals migrate, or stay on campus to design robots or study with a prize-winning journalist.\r\n\r\nW&J students study hard, but they are also active outside of the classroom. Almost 30% of students belong to Greek organizations. With close proximity to Pittsburgh, W&J students can easily travel into the city on college-run vans to see professional sports events, shop, eat in fine restaurants, attend theatre or ballet performances, or listen to renowned speakers.  \r\n\r\nW&J was honored with the President's Honor Roll for Community Service with Distinction; students volunteer more than 15,000 hours a year in service to our community. They raise money for cancer research, volunteer at the Humane Society, read to first graders and to the blind, and help staff the Washington Women's Shelter. \r\n\r\nW&J also has a strong tradition of producing student-athletes. The College fields 24 intercollegiate sports and is still the smallest college ever to compete in the Rose Bowl, battling California to a zero-zero tie in the 1922 game. Student athletes from W&J include Charlie West, the first African-American quarterback in the Rose Bowl game, and legendary coaches such as John Heisman. \r\n\r\nWith about 12,000 living alumni, W&J has graduated leaders in almost every field, from architecture to zoology. The College boasts civic leaders like James G. Blaine (1847), who served as secretary of state and ran for president three times; as well as pioneers such as Joseph Walker, who made the first NASA x-15 flight and was the first to pilot the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle; and Jesse Lazear, who studied yellow fever in Cuba with Walter Reed. W&J also educated NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell '81 and Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl '03, the youngest mayor of a major U.S. city in the United States.\r\n\r\nStudents and graduates alike are experiencing incredible success in a variety of fields inside and outside the classroom, and the John A. Swanson Science Center, as expected, opened in early 2010. W&J is a college on the move, looking to the future with great optimism while building on its historical past."

            "As a leading national research university, Washington State University provides an exceptional education to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. Students work side-by-side with professors whose scholarship and research are at the frontiers of knowledge.  Among the faculty are members of the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, Institute of Medicine, and recipients of numerous national awards and fellowships. WSU is Washington's only land-grant institution. It emphasizes hands-on learning both in and out of the classroom. Undergraduate students experience groundbreaking research firsthand and gain an edge in applying for distinguished national fellowships and to exclusive graduate and professional programs. Many undergraduates present papers at conferences and publish their research findings in scholarly journals. They enter national competitions in areas as varied as mock trial, interior design, business plans, and robotics. The University has a spirited sense of community that infuses academics throughout its residential main campus in southeastern Washington. Freshman Focus living-learning communities bring academics into the residence halls, and a Common Reading program for freshmen stimulates discussion in the classroom and across campus. The University emphasizes international experiences for students and offers more than 1,200 choices for education abroad. Additionally, students volunteer more than 30,000 hours of service in a typical academic year through the Center for Civic Engagement. Fortune 500 and other employers actively recruit interns and graduates, whom many consider the best qualified in the state. Across the University's twelve colleges, many academic programs rank among the nation's finest. Particularly well known is the Edward R. Murrow College of Communication, named for the University's distinguished alumnus, where students gain hands-on experience at student-run television and radio stations. The Honors College is one of the oldest and most respected university-wide programs for high-achieving students, with an enriched liberal arts curriculum and a global perspective. Talented graduate students from around the world come to the University to work alongside its pioneering faculty. In the molecular biosciences, faculty members are noted worldwide for their work in protein biochemistry, DNA repair, structural biology, and reproductive biology.

Professors in the plant sciences and zoology stand among the most productive, widely published scholars in the nation. Veterinary and health science research conducted in WSU's College of Veterinary Medicine and School for Global Animal Health, is among the most frequently cited by peer scientists in peer-reviewed publications.  In the liberal arts, the English department is home to nationally recognized authors and alumni. Research conducted in the Department of Sociology and the communication college influences policy that touches lives nationwide. Distinctive facilities include the Smith Center for Undergraduate Education, with the latest teaching technologies; the award-winning Student Recreation Center; modern student dining facilities, and a fully renovated student union building with a state-of-the-art auditorium, meeting rooms, lounges, and food court. In Martin Stadium, Beasley Coliseum, and other athletic venues, the Pac-10 Cougars challenge top men's and women's teams to the cheers of devoted fans.

            "Wells College is a coeducational, private, liberal arts college located on a beautiful 365-acre lakeside campus situated in the heart of the Finger Lakes Region of New York State in the historical village of Aurora. True to its heritage, Wells maintains a national reputation for academic excellence. The College prides itself on offering one of the most collaborative learning environments in higher education today.\r\n\r\nThis is not your ordinary education.  The Wells experience is deeply personal and intensely focused on superior academic achievement.  Wells offers 23 majors and over 40 minors. With one professor for every ten students, professors really get to know everyone.  The average class size has fourteen students and is taught seminar-style, with discussions taking precedence over lectures.  \r\n\r\nSince 1868 we've been encouraging our students to step outside the classroom.  Why?  Because the best education combines traditional studies with real-world experiences.  Last year, the Wells Office of Career Services coordinated internships in twenty states, the District of Columbia, France and Senegal.  By graduation, 97% of seniors had completed at least one internship.  Your education won't stop at the edge of campus.  Recent internships include: The White House, ABC Television, Aquarium of the Pacific, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Smithsonian Institution, and many more.  \r\n\r\nWells also offers an extensive study abroad program with affiliated programs in 13 different countries.  Our staff will help you pursue your academic interests wherever they lead you.  You might study ecosystems in Australia's Outback or work in labs, film studios or research hospitals anywhere in the world.  Although the two most popular programs are in Florence and Paris, you could study almost anywhere.  We also work with affiliated institutions to make sure your learning opportunities are as rich and varied as possible.  For example, if you find the perfect course at Cornell University or the London School of Economics, we'll do our best to get you there.  \r\n\r\nThere are many opportunities for you to develop your leadership skills through over 40 different organizations including a literary magazine and newspaper, music and drama groups, and political organizations.  Wells is a Division III member of the NCAA with intercollegiate women's teams in basketball, cross-country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, and tennis and intercollegiate men's teams in basketball, cross-country, golf, lacrosse, soccer and swimming. Women's basketball is a new intercollegiate sport for the 2010-2011 academic year.  \r\n\r\nWells students are intellectually curious, open-minded, and creative. They are comfortable expressing themselves, listening to others and sharing ideas.  They are caring citizens of the world, eager to travel beyond the campus and outside their comfort zones.  Wells students love to learn.  If you love learning, you'll love the Wells experience."

            "Forever first for women's education - striving for excellence, grounded in faith, and engaged in service to the world.  Founded in 1836 as the first college in the world for women, Wesleyan College offers an education that leads to lifelong intellectual, personal, and professional growth.  Our academic community attracts those with a passion for learning and making a difference.  The Wesleyan experience has four cornerstones:  Academics, Women, Faith, and Community.  We believe that real education is a lifelong endeavor, fueled by curiosity, challenge, and discovery.  Providing a solid foundation for a lifetime of learning and growth.  Mention the term \"women's college\" and most people envision ivy-covered towers in the U.S. northeast.  However, Wesleyan College in Macon, Georgia, a four-year liberal arts college founded in 1836, has the distinction of being the world's first degree-granting college for women.  Today it is recognized as one of the nation's most diverse and affordable selective colleges.  Students value the College's tradition of service, small classes, beautiful residence halls and picturesque campus.  Wesleyan is committed to the goals of educating women to understand and appreciate the liberal and fine arts and preparing them for careers through high-quality professional programs."

            "A campus of the University of North Carolina system, Western Carolina University provides outstanding opportunities for students in a supportive living-learning environment that encourages interaction with faculty, participation in organized community service activities and preparation for future careers. In 2008, WCU adopted a new quality enhancement plan as part of its successful effort to earn re-accreditation from the Southern Association of Schools and Colleges. The plan is a framework for helping students become engaged and intentional in their own educations by encouraging them to reflect on how their classroom experience connects to what they learn outside the classroom and how everything in their university experience connects to their career and life goals. SACS reviewers expressed enthusiastic approval for the plan and urged the university to move forward with it. At the same time, faculty adopted a new tenure policy that rewards professors for using their scholarly expertise to address the needs of the region. The policy adds a new dimension to the traditional evaluation of faculty on the quality of their teaching and research. In response to increased student enrollment and changes in academic programs, the university was restructured, creating a new College of Fine and Performing Arts and a new College of Health and Human Sciences. WCU also encompasses an Honors College; Kimmel School of Construction Management and Technology; and the colleges of Business, Arts and Sciences, and Education and Allied Professions. Students continue to give WCU high marks on the National Survey of Student Engagement. In nearly all measures of student engagement, WCU is above its peers. Among its first-year students, WCU performed better on all five benchmarks than its peers and was ranked significantly better than the NSSE national average on active and collaborative learning, student-faculty interaction and supportive campus environment. Among seniors, WCU performed significantly better than its peers and the NSSE cohort on active and collaborative learning and student-faculty interaction. In 2008, WCU opened a $16.7 million, 73,000-square-foot Campus Recreation Center. A $17.6 million dining hall will open in fall 2009, as well as the first of two adjoining residence halls, a combined $50.2 million project. In accordance with plans to develop its Millennial Initiative, a 344-acre project that doubles the size of campus, WCU is moving forward with a new $46.2 million health and gerontological sciences building. It will house educational and outreach programs as well as state-of-the-art laboratories and classrooms for nursing, social work, physical therapy, athletic training, environmental health, health information administration, nutrition and dietetics, emergency medical care, recreational therapy and communication sciences and disorders. For the past four years, WCU students have ranked in the top 10 at the prestigious annual National Conference on Undergraduate Research, consistently leading the way among UNC institutions. In 2009, WCU became one of only 83 institutions nationally named to the President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll with Distinction by the Corporation for National and Community Service. U.S. News and World Report's \"Best Colleges Guide\" in 2008 ranked WCU among the top public master's degree-granting institutions in the South and recognized WCU in its \"Great Schools, Great Prices\" section. The Princeton Review ranked WCU's College of Business among the nation's best schools at which to earn a master's degree in business administration, with WCU's program earning a top-four spot among schools offering the greatest opportunity for women and receiving high marks for small class sizes. WCU's online master's degree program in project management and online bachelor's degree program in criminal justice have received No. 1 national rankings in quality and affordability by GetEducated.com."

Our academic programs are excellent and most classes are collaborative, taught seminar style with lots of group projects that stress initiative, teamwork and communication skills. Our alumni praise the values and skills taught and modeled by our faculty and staff.  Students, faculty and staff describe Westminster as a cherished \"way of life!\" Best of all, Westminster is made up of quality people -- a COMMUNITY of students, faculty and staff."

            "Westminster College offers a truly unique environment for learning in a location that is recognized as a quality of life hotspot. Utah was recently rated the #1 best state to live in and the #1 city for job growth by Forbes, Outside magazine rated Salt Lake City a \"near-perfect location for avid outdoor adventurers\" and Men's Fitness rated Salt Lake as the nation???s fittest city. Located where the city of Salt Lake meets the Rocky Mountains and deeply committed to each student's success, Westminster is a comprehensive college that integrates a strong foundation in liberal education with cutting-edge professional programs at both the undergraduate and graduate level. Our purposes are to prepare students to lead lives of learning, accomplishment, and service, and to help them develop skills and attributes critical for success in a rapidly changing world. Westminster students take advantage of our unique approach to learning characterized by active, hands-on, collaborative, and cross-disciplinary experiences, coupled with close, mentoring relationships with faculty. All freshmen participate in learning communities; service-learning opportunities abound; and more than 85 percent of students participate in internships before they graduate. Westminster has more than 70 academic programs, including 36 undergraduate majors and 13 graduate degrees. Some unique and very popular programs include the aviation program, including our own flight center at Salt Lake International Airport; Honors; the McNair Scholars program, an elite national graduate school preparation program for low-income, first generation and underrepresented students; Winter at Westminster, a study abroad alternative that combines once-in-a-lifetime snow sports activities with 12-16 transferable credits; Westminster Scholars, a problem-based curriculum, and May Term, which is free to students who enrolled full-time the previous spring and fall. Throughout their education, students are challenged to experiment with ideas, raise questions, critically examine alternatives, and make informed decisions. Students are encouraged to accept responsibility for their own learning, to discover and pursue their passions, and to act with responsibility. The culture at Westminster is easy-going, laid-back, and welcoming. The vibrant campus community is diverse with undergraduates and graduates, residents and commuters -- students of all ages and from all kinds of different backgrounds. The college has students from 43 different states and 31 countries, who have all kinds of different interests, passions and talents. But, with a total enrollment of just 3,000, every one of them finds the niche."

            "Located between Boston and Providence, R.I., Wheaton College can be found in the town of Norton, Mass. Originally founded in 1834 as a female seminary, it became a women’s college in 1912 and finally began admitting men in 1988. Students admitted to the college have the opportunity to select from about 40 majors and more than 70 student-run clubs and organizations. Academically, students are required to complete “connections,” a series of linked courses that approaches a subject matter from different perspectives and disciplines, giving the student a broad, wide-ranging view of knowledge. As a residential college, Wheaton requires most students to live on campus, although off-campus housing can be arranged if needed. Students can choose to live in traditional residence houses or themed houses, which place students with like interests in the same living area. Known as the Lyons, Wheaton College is a member of the New England Women’s and Men’s Athletic Conference in the NCAA Division III, and the college fields 21 intercollegiate teams for men and women."

            "Ocean View - Ocean Point of View\r\nThe California Maritime Academy???s waterside campus on the northern end of San Francisco Bay is tucked into a quiet cove with ever-changing views of the ever-changing maritime world.  This world is much more than operating commercial ships; it is a global economic force linking with various modes of transportation to get commodities and people from point A to point B.  Operating this global enterprise requires engineers, business leaders, port managers, deck officers, environmental advocates, maritime security consultants, etc.  \r\n\r\nThe ???Academy??? Advantage\r\nAcademies are generally small, focused, structured, and offer a high-quality education.  These characteristics all describe Cal Maritime. Our 825 students study one of only six majors, and students are generally very focused on their chosen fields. We stress some similar values as the military academies ??? but our students have no obligation to join the military when they graduate.  Our reputation among the many corporations, industries, agencies, and graduate schools filled with Cal Maritime alumni is that of a school preparing professional, responsible, and successful graduates\r\n\r\nThe Value of a CSU Campus plus the Quality of a Private College\r\nAs one of the 23 campuses in the California State University (CSU) system, Cal Maritime enjoys the strength associated with this planet???s biggest university system.  Tuition and housing costs are no more than other CSU campuses up and down the state which makes us highly affordable. Our academic quality, however, shares more in common with private colleges. Our average class size of 23 student as well as approachable, mentoring faculty creates an academic atmosphere\r\n\r\nThe Corps of Cadets Stressing Responsibility, Accountability, Leadership, and Professionalism\r\nAt Cal Maritime, all students are also cadets who comprise the Corps of Cadets that forms the basic organizational structure of the Academy.  Your classes will teach you the ???hard??? skills and knowledge for your degree, but the Corps of Cadets stresses the ???soft??? skills such as responsibility, accountability, leadership, and professionalism.  Those soft skills are what give Cal Maritime graduates such an advantage in their job search and later careers.\r\n\r\nTraining and Learning on the Golden Bear\r\nAll Cal Maritime cadets become members of the crew of the 500 foot Training Ship GOLDEN BEAR on at least one sixty day journey visiting a number of ports around the Pacific Rim.  The cadets run the ship (including the bridge and engine room) under the supervision of licensed maritime professionals. Cadets also take classes, perform ship maintenance, and gain a first-hand exposure to ship operations.\r\n\r\nInternational Travel for All\r\nOne important way that Cal Maritime supports ensures a global perspective in its graduates is the required GOLDEN BEAR experience.  With each voyage visiting three or four international ports, 100% of our cadets travel abroad ??? learning about world travel related to their intended careers and soaking up local culture.  Many students also participate in port field trips to gain exposure to the how business and international affairs are conducted in distant parts of the world.\r\n\r\nAll Students have a Paid Summer Internship\r\nA dedicated staff in our Career Development Center works very hard to gather a large list of companies and organizations willing to offer various forms of internships or co-ops and then working with the cadets to match their available internships with specific professional goals.  \r\n\r\nOur Industry Connections Lead to Great Careers\r\nCal Maritime alumni predominate in maritime industry around the Pacific Rim.  Those who influence hiring and promotion have direct knowledge of the quality and relevancy of the education we provide. Several of the same companies and agencies that hire Cal Maritime graduates have many other connections to the Academy."

            "As one of nine polytechnic universities nationwide, Cal Poly Pomona integrates a learn-by-doing approach into its project and presentation-based coursework.  This long-standing polytechnic approach makes it unique among traditional universities and has earned Cal Poly Pomona the reputation of developing individuals who are among the most sought after in today's marketplace.\r\n\r\nA nationally-recognized public university with a number of highly respected and ranked programs, Cal Poly Pomona provides its students an excellent environment for academic, personal and professional success.  The U.S. Department of Education, U.S. News & World Report, Black Issues in Higher Education, Design Intelligence, Hispanic Outlook Magazine, Journal of Hospitality Management, Los Angeles Times Business Journal and Project Connect have ranked Cal Poly Pomona in numerous categories.\r\n\r\nCal Poly Pomona is located on the eastern edge of Southern California's San Gabriel Valley.  The site of the university is the former winter ranch of William K. Kellogg, the cereal magnate.  The university's 1,400-acre campus features lush rolling hills; flowers, plants and trees from all seven continents; a rose garden personally built by Kellogg; and a beautifully landscaped Japanese Garden.  The university's aesthetic qualities are one of its best kept secrets.  Some of the world's finest architects and landscape architects designed and built the ranch - a hybrid of architecture, which combined the formal courtyards, gardens and elements of Spanish, Italian and Islamic architecture with the informality of a growing nouveau-riche society.  Pasadena architect Myron Hunt (Rose Bowl, Huntington Library) designed Kellogg's main house.  Charles Gibbs Adams, whose work included the Hearst Castle Gardens in San Simeon, California, was selected to landscape the grounds.  Later, the landscape was completed by Florence Yoch and Lucille Council, widely recognized as two of the finest garden designers and landscape architects in California.  More recently, Antoine Predock designed the University's administration building with a desert theme.\r\n\r\nThe university has a distinguished history with its origin as a private school.  Two national icons, Charles B. Voorhis, a prominent automotive industry figure, and Kellogg, contributed to the University's establishment and success.  Voorhis entered the automobile business as a sales manager, joining the Oakland Motor Car Company (General Motors) of Pontiac, Michigan in 1914 and rose to become vice-president.  In 1917, he helped found the Nash Motors Company with then GM President Charles W. Nash.  In 1928, Voorhis opened the Voorhis School for Boys in San Dimas, California, a college for homeless young men which he endowed and served as chairman of the board.  With the help of his son, Jerry Voorhis, a U. S. Congressman, the Voorhis School for Boys became one of the most popular institutions in Southern California.  In 1938, the Voorhis School for Boys became known as the Voorhis Unit of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo when the State of California acquired the private school.  In 1949, the Voorhis Unit acquired Kellogg's winter ranch.\r\n\r\nIn 1925, Kellogg fulfilled a dream when he moved to Pomona, California to start an Arabian horse breeding program, the oldest in the United States and the fifth largest in the country today.  More than 70% of the domestic Arabian bloodstock in the U.S. can trace its lineage to the original breeding program.  With the assistance of Richard Nixon and then U.S. President Harry S. Truman, Kellogg's desire to have the ranch become an institution of higher education became a reality.  A stipulation in maintaining the property is that the University continues Kellogg's tradition of a Sunday Arabian horse show.  On the first Sunday of the month from October through May, students host public performances."

            "At Sacramento State, \"Leadership begins here\" is more than a slogan. We offer students life-changing opportunities to become leaders in their communities. Opportunities to learn from great teachers. Opportunities for one-of-a-kind internships and research experiences. And, through our location in the heart of California's Capital City, opportunities to make a difference through public service.\r\n\r\nSacramento State is a vibrant metropolitan university that is among the largest campuses in the California State University system. We enroll a multicultural student body of 28,000, and graduate about 6,000 students each year. Despite our size, quality teaching in small classes remains a top priority. Students enjoy personalized attention from their professors, as well as extensive research and internship opportunities in Sacramento, the heart of California government.\r\n\r\nWe're particularly proud of our beautiful 300-acre campus, with its lush landscaping and 3,000 trees. Miles of trails stretch along the nearby American River Parkway, linking our campus and student housing with recreational areas such as Folsom Lake and Old Sacramento.\r\n\r\nSacramento State remains one of the nation's best higher education values, with student fees among the lowest in the nation. About half of our students receive some form of financial assistance.\r\n\r\nSacramento State is looking to the future with a major campus initiative - Destination 2010 - designed to make this a premier metropolitan university and a destination campus for the West. Current students, as well as future students, will benefit from the changes and improvements to our academic program, student services and facilities. Included in the planning is a new Science and Space Center with a state-of-the-art planetarium. Also in the works are a large student recreation center, an arena and stadium upgrades within our Alex G. Spanos Sports Complex.\r\n\r\nThe city of Sacramento is one of the state's most affordable big cities, and the area has a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. The region's mild climate, rivers and nearby recreation areas make it popular with outdoor enthusiasts. Popular attractions include the State Capitol building, the State Railroad Museum and the Crocker Art Museum. Within easy driving distance are San Francisco, the Napa and Sonoma valleys, the historic gold country and the Lake Tahoe region's ski slopes."

            "California State University, Stanislaus is widely known as the most beautiful and friendly of the California State University (CSU) campuses, blending modern facilities with the pastoral charm of the countryside. The University serves the state's northern Central Valley and with a total enrollment of 8,836, provides a small private school atmosphere at a public school price.  The campus enjoys an ideal location in the heart of California's Central Valley, a short distance from the San Francisco Bay Area, Monterey, Big Sur, the Sierra Nevada mountains, and Yosemite National Park. The proximity allows for hiking, skiing, snowboarding, kayaking, surfing and other outdoors sports and activities. Six colleges provide sixty-three undergraduate majors with business, liberal studies, nursing, psychology, social work, criminal justice, and biology the most popular. The music and art programs are also of a high caliber with successful graduates in every area of the arts. The average class size for undergraduates is 24 and the student/faculty ratio is 19 to 1.\r\nThe campus has undergone dramatic physical and educational transformation with the new Nora and Hashem Naraghi Hall of Science, a $54 million state-of-the-art facility for the sciences and health programs. A Student Recreation Complex, complete with a modern exercise facility, new stadium and other sports amenities, will be completed in 2008 as will a new and vastly expanded bookstore.\r\nDiversity is strong at CSU Stanislaus where Hispanic students make up 28 percent of the student body, Asian/Pacific Islanders 11 percent, African Americans four percent, and international and Native American students one percent each. CSU Stanislaus boasts one of the highest retention rates among the 23 CSU campuses. Student success is facilitated by a dense network of on-campus resources that recognizes that much of the student body consists of first-generation college students. Consistent advising including a strong first year program, frequent and meaningful contact with professors, and supportive staff and administrators all help the cause.  \r\nCSU Stanislaus boasts over 80 students clubs ranging from rock climbing to dance, along with ten national honor society chapters. There are also five fraternities and eight sororities. On-campus housing provides a safe and home-like atmosphere with a gated community, multiple dining options, laundry facilities, and computer labs.\r\nCSU Stanislaus disbursed more than $21.2 million in merit- and need-based grants and scholarships for the 2007-2008 school year. The scholarships range from full tuition, board and books through the President's Scholarship program to hundreds of other scholarships ranging from $100 to $5,000 per school year. \r\nGovernment agencies, hospitals and medical centers, banks, and school districts are among the top employers that recruit CSU Stanislaus students on campus at career fairs. The University also has a strong nursing program that has prepared over 900 students for the in-demand field. The Alumni Association was recently turned into an Alumni Council in which all alumni are members and benefit from networking, services and discounts, and social functions.\r\nPart of the school's high retention and student satisfaction rates are due to the emphasis placed on welcoming students to campus each year. Village Welcome Week offers a lively series of activities to greet residential students from day one. The next week brings Campus Welcome Week, which celebrates the arrival of all students with a full week of activities. Warrior Day and Homecoming are two major campus traditions. In the spring, Warrior Day brings a similarly celebratory mood to campus with food, fun, and live tunes. The University's art gallery, which opened with the school in 1965, gives students hands-on experience with contemporary art, exposure to other cultures, and opportunities for artistic advancement and leadership."

            "During a recent school year Calvin College had four members of its community honored as Fulbright Scholars: a trio of professors and a student. All four were able, thanks to the Fulbright program, to spend time studying and researching their academic disciplines in such locales as China, Hong Kong, Ghana and the Netherlands. Of the opportunity one of Calvin's Fulbright Scholars said simply: \"I've found cultural exchange to be one of the most rewarding components of spending time abroad. Even the simplest of conversations with an individual from a foreign culture can impact the way we see the world. Spending time abroad has made that abundantly clear.\" Calvin also brings cultural exchange to its 400-acre campus in Grand Rapids where in 2009-2010 some 400 students, or 10 percent of the student body, hailed from outside the U.S. In addition off-campus programs take students to more than 20 locations around the globe, including Britain, China, Hungary, Honduras and Spain, while service-learning projects and internships help Calvin students explore their gifts in Grand Rapids and beyond while gaining valuable experience.The Calvin curriculum, including a core built on core knowledge (knowledge of God, the world and ourselves), core skills (reasoning, communication, technology, research and physical) and core virtues (diligence, patience, honesty, courage, charity, creativity, empathy, humility, stewardship, compassion, justice, faith, hope and wisdom)  gives the college's 4,000 students a broad and diverse learning experience with majors, minors and academic programs in everything from Asian Studies, biochemistry and engineering to elementary education, youth ministry leadership and speech pathology. In all subjects students explore all things while combining faith and learning in real, meaningful and lasting ways.More than 80 percent of Calvin professors hold the highest degree in their field, while the student to faculty ratio is just 11:1 and the average class size at Calvin is just 22 students.Outcomes for Calvin graduates are good. The college is one of the top producers in the country of students who go on to earn a doctoral degree. And in a recent survey, 96 percent of Calvin graduates reported that they had either secured a job or begun graduate school within six months of graduation."

            "Cardinal Stritch University is an independent Franciscan Catholic institution of higher education sponsored by the Sisters of St. Francis of Assisi. The University, rooted in the liberal arts, provides graduate and undergraduate programs to prepare students for life and for professional careers.\r\n\r\nThe University assists women and men in pursuing lifelong learning. It provides both traditional and nontraditional approaches to meet the educational needs of a diverse student body. The University strives to be a caring community. Its faculty and staff regard superior instruction and personal attention to each student as keys to quality education. In addition, faculty members model and promote meaningful integration of theory and practice.\r\n\r\nFaculty, staff, administration and trustees cooperate actively to anticipate and address the emerging needs of students, the Stritch community and society. The vitality of educational life is enhanced by the commitment of the University to programs of direct service to people who might not otherwise be served.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with Franciscan values and guided by the Judaeo-Christian tradition, the University fosters the moral, spiritual, intellectual, cultural, emotional, social and physical development of each person. Finally, the University promotes the development of men and women who are committed to religious principles, who possess moral and aesthetic values, and who take their places as responsible persons, serving the local and global communities.\r\n\r\nThe College of Arts and Sciences offers more than 30 fields of study in 13 different departments and both undergraduate and graduate degrees. Although the major academic programs vary from one another in content and direction, they are all grounded in the same core values and disciplines of the liberal arts.  Our diverse student body and small student-to-faculty ratio make learning a rich and satisfying experience. Classes are taught by well-qualified professors rather than teaching assistants. Individualized academic advising, at the department and general level, helps provide a framework on which to build a personal education plan.\r\n\r\nThe College of Business provides high-quality, practical education that leads to undergraduate and master's degrees. All programs are accelerated, with classes meeting one night a week in convenient locations for working adults.  Students in the College receive extensive support through simplified registration, delivery of all study materials to class sites, access to advanced library technology and personalized educational counseling.\r\n\r\nThe College of Education has more than 60 years of experience in the field of education and a reputation for innovative, cutting-edge programs. Our undergraduate programs are a joint venture with public and private schools, which provide laboratory settings and reflect our commitment to urban education. Our students learn to become educators who value their students' diverse abilities and backgrounds and understand how to work collaboratively.  The Doctorate in Leadership for the Advancement of Learning and Service is designed for professionals from an array of businesses or organizations who want to develop or enhance their leadership skills. The program emphasizes a balance of theory, research, reflection and practice and is designed for completion within three years.\r\n\r\nThe College of Nursing offers a highly personal approach to teaching.  Nursing is a high-touch career. At Stritch, we believe your education should be high touch as well. Here, you'll find small classrooms, flexible scheduling, and lots of one-on-one instruction. You'll also find a comfortable, supportive environment and nursing programs that are as holistic as the science of nursing itself.  Stritch is the only school in Wisconsin offering the full range of nursing programs, from ADN through MSN degrees."

The Carnegie Mellon Tartans compete in NCAA Division III competitions, and the Kiltie Band, which sports full Scottish regalia, performs at every home football game."

            "Campus activities are a big part of student life at Whitman College, a liberal arts institution in the rural small town of Walla Walla, Wash. Students come out in droves for intramural sports—about 70 percent compete on some team—and Greek life. Though the school only has a handful of sororities and fraternities, about a third of the student body is involved in the Greek system. About 20 percent of students compete on the Whit varsity sports teams, all members of the NCAA Division III Northwest Conference. If going Greek or playing sports isn’t your thing, there are more than 100 other student clubs and organizations to check out, too. The campus has an indoor rock climbing facility, where students can climb for fun or for course credit. Outdoor recreation lovers can also earn academic credits in unique courses such as Glacier Mountaineering, Kayaking, or Wilderness Skills. The student Outdoor Program coordinates just-for-fun recreation trips, too, like moonlight sea kayaking and white water rafting. Students at Whitman can also take advantage of the school’s western location by enrolling in the unique Semester in the West program, a three-month long journey through Oregon, Nevada, California, Utah, and Idaho in a converted horse trailer. Freshmen and sophomores must live on campus, which is three blocks from downtown Walla Walla. The town is rich in local charm and home to the popular Walla Walla Balloon Stampede, an annual parade of hot air balloons. Located in southeastern Washington, Walla Walla is not in close proximity to any major towns, but students can get to Spokane, Wash., in 2.5 hours; Portland, Ore., in four hours; and Seattle in 4.5 hours. Students begin and end their education at Whitman in unique fashion: All freshmen must take a two-semester transition program into a liberal arts education called Encounters, and all seniors must complete an oral examination before graduation."

            "Whittier College is a vibrant, residential four-year liberal arts institution, where intellectual inquiry and experiential learning are fostered in a community that promotes respect for diversity of thought and culture. With 43 percent of its students hailing from traditionally under-represented groups, and its federal designation as a Hispanic-Serving Institution, Whittier College remains one of the most diverse liberal arts schools in the nation. The College's location at the crossroads of Los Angeles and Orange Counties - Southern California's centers of urban and cultural life - provides unparalleled opportunities to explore a full range of thought, cultures, and talents.  Nationally recognized for its Whittier Scholars Program, interdisciplinary curriculum, and emphasis on linking theory and practice, Whittier College's academic program is progressive; students gain a wide breadth of knowledge and the confidence to apply that knowledge, primed to flourish in graduate studies, the evolving global workplace, and life.  Working closely with professors and with the advantage of small class size, students have extensive undergraduate research opportunities, which atypically extend beyond the natural and physical sciences to include social sciences, humanities, and the arts. Multitudes of students have become published authors through joint research endeavors and have actively participated in national professional conferences.  Whittier faculty also embrace the educational advantages provided through experiential learning; a high percentage of students engage in off-campus study both locally and abroad, academically supported through research trips, fieldwork, service projects, and professional internships. Popular with students is the January Interim session, an abbreviated but rigorous term that offers intense focus on subject matter, typically followed by a field trip to apply learning. Recent courses included travel to Mexico to study multinational management practices; Chile to analyze the politics of race, religion, and gender in action; Paris to examine historical social construct through city planning; and Rome to explore origins of art and architecture. Whittier's 50-year association with the DIS-Copenhagen program remains the most popular semester abroad option, though recent choice destinations have included India, China, Egypt, Africa, and South America.  Hosting nearly 90 registered student organizations, club sports, and honorary societies, as well as 21 NCAA Division III competitive sports teams - including champion lacrosse and water polo teams - Whittier College affords students the opportunity to participate in all aspects of student life. The intimate size of the campus, educational and social events hosted at the Faculty Masters' homes, themed living-learning groups, and inherently inclusive Quaker values of truth, acceptance, justice, community, service, and diversity each contribute to the strong sense of community experienced by all. In particular, strong faculty-student relationships are forged here - through collaborative projects, mentoring, and social interaction - that extend well beyond the college years and most often result in professional networking, graduate study references, and career assistance later in life.  Combining experience, academics, and environment, Whittier graduates emerge well-prepared for leadership in a global economy across a variety of sectors, including public service, education and social work, science and health, entrepreneurial business, and the arts."

            "Located in Oregon’s state capital, Salem, Willamette University carries the distinction of being the oldest university in the Western United States. The 69-acre campus is located directly across from the Oregon State Capitol and is less than an hour from Portland, Ore. All freshmen and sophomores are required to live on campus, unless they commute 25 miles or less to campus, after which they can move into private residences or one of the university’s apartment complexes. Once at the college, students can participate in more than 100 clubs and organizations, including a small, but bustling, Greek life. Studying abroad is a very popular academic choice for many students at the university, and more than half of the student body studies abroad during their college career. Students interested in studying abroad have the luxury of choosing programs from more than 40 countries. The university also has a partnership with Tokyo International University, which allows students interested in Japanese language and culture the chance to interact with Japanese students. The sustainable efforts of Willamette University have not gone unnoticed. The National Wildlife Federation recognized the university as first in the nation among 1,050-plus schools for practicing the most sustainable activities, many of which are student-initiated efforts.

            "The Jewell experience focuses on enhancing a student's ability to apply learning to complex ethical, scientific and cultural problems. The College places a high value on experiential learning and gives students the opportunity to \"live what they learn.\" Students who complete the College's 38-hour liberal arts core plus three applied learning experiences receive a second major in Applied Critical Thought and Inquiry (ACT-In). As a result, all students can graduate with double majors in four years. The ACT-In option is a reflection of the College's philosophy that education must take students beyond thinking and inquiring, and to action. Beginning with the entering class in the fall of 2010, every student who successfully completes the sophomore year will be eligible to receive a \"Journey Grant\" to fund a transformative hands-on experience. Journey Grants can support self-designed research projects, study-away opportunities, internships, civic engagement initiatives or service projects at home or abroad. Students can pool grants together to create substantive collaborative projects.  In addition to ACT-In, other distinctive programs are available to Jewell students. The internationally recognized Oxbridge Honors Program, supported by the Hall Family Foundation, combines British tutorial methods of instruction with a year of study in Oxford or Cambridge. It is the only program of its kind in the nation. Jewell's undergraduate Nonprofit Leadership major is one of only 13 nationwide and ranks among the top three in academic rigor. The Pryor Leadership Studies Program includes course work, community service projects and internships that help students enhance their leadership skills in a variety of settings. The Harriman-Jewell Series is considered one of the great performing arts presenting series in the country. More than 850 world-class performances and 19 American recital debuts, including that of Luciano Pavarotti in 1973, have come to Kansas City by way of this program.  The Center for Justice and Sustainability at William Jewell is at the heart of the College's mission to cultivate leadership, service, and spiritual growth. The Center's role in this mission is to raise awareness of social, economic, and ecological challenges within our world in order to invite students to spend their lives creating solutions to these complex and interconnected issues.  Finally, William Jewell College believes graduation in four years should be an expectation of all students. The College's Four-Year Graduation Guarantee ensures timely completion of a great liberal arts education, positioning our students for transition into graduate school or career choices ahead of most peers. Students who follow academic advising guidelines are guaranteed to graduate four years (eight consecutive semesters) from the date of their original matriculation. Students following these basic guidelines who do not meet graduation requirements after four years may take up to an additional 16 credit hours required for graduation within one year of the originally projected graduation date, free of tuition and fees."

            "Among the 13 colleges located in Worcester, Mass., Worcester Polytechnic Institute stands out as a close-knit private school grounded in scientific education. The student body is actively engaged in campus activities, such as the rivalry contests like the gigantic tug-of-war held throughout the year that pit the freshmen class against the sophomores. More than 30 percent of students are members of the school’s 15 or so fraternities and sororities. Even more—close 70 percent—are involved in campus sports at some level. The WPI Engineers compete in the NCAA Division III New England Men’s and Women’s Athletic Conference, supported by mascot Gompei, a goat. Though the original school mascot was the head of a once-live goat, the school now uses a man-made replica for a mascot. WPI students also come out in droves for the school’s club sports and intramural program, and all students must take four physical education courses, ranging from lifeguarding to", 
            ". Freshmen do not have to live in campus residence facilities, which include standard dormitories and four houses with student-selected themes. A university seal is imprinted on the ground in the center of campus, but make sure not to step on it; school lore warns that any student who does won’t graduate on time. Off campus, students can use Woo Cards to get discounts on food and activities around Worcester. Boston is 45 miles away, or about an hour’s trip by train."

            "While every institution claims to be student-centered, few are as committed to individual attention as Xavier University. As a Jesuit institution, the Cincinnati school stresses academic rigor, service to others, and teaching. Yet what separates Xavier is its focus on the individual and the sense of community on campus. Need to meet your professor outside of class time and office hours? No problem. Want help with a roommate, a bill or registration? There's an office devoted to handling any need. These are some of the reasons why Xavier ranks among comprehensive universities as one of the national leaders in student retention."

            "Xavier University of Louisiana is Catholic and historically Black. The ultimate purpose of the University is the promotion of a more just and humane society. To this end, Xavier prepares its students to assume roles of leadership and service in society. This preparation takes place in a pluralistic teaching and learning environment that incorporates all relevant educational means, including research and community service.\r\nSo that they will be able to assume roles of leadership and service, Xavier graduates will be: prepared for continual spiritual, moral, and intellectual development; liberally educated in the knowledge and skills required for leadership and service; and educated in a major field so that they are prepared to complete graduate or professional school and to succeed in a career and in life. \r\nRecent enrollment and retention decreases have been recognized as a few of the temporary effects of Hurricane Katrina.  As more students return we look forward to Xavier University of Louisiana once again being a leader amongst the nations colleges and universities.   Our current Student Government President illustrates the unique qualities and strengths of our institution.\r\nA Message from the SGA President \r\n\r\nOn behalf of the students of Xavier University of Louisiana, it is my pleasure to invite you to consider a college experience that will change and enhance your life forever. \r\n\r\nXavier alumni are known across the world for being exceptional doctors and lawyers, educators and journalists, philanthropists, research scientists and the like. And despite the damages to our campus last August from Hurricane Katrina, I can assure you that choosing Xavier is still a great choice indeed. \r\n\r\nAs a Senior Business Administration major with a concentration in Finance, and president of the Student Government Association (SGA) I know that Xavier has thoroughly prepared me for my career in Corporate America while nurturing me spiritually and socially. True, I never might have imagined attending a school in a city that experienced so much tragedy following Hurricane Katrina. However, with tragedy comes great opportunity to triumph. \r\n\r\nSince our campus reopened in January 2006 after repairing the hurricane damage, the Xavier family has grown stronger. People in general seem more appreciative of friends, family, and what some might call sentimental values. In a way, Hurricane Katrina may have added to the character of people, and enhanced the very principles this university was founded upon. \r\n\r\nThe university's founder, St. Katharine Drexel, understood the necessity to provide minority students with a quality education - second to none - and the skills needed to be better leaders AND servers, in order to help build a more just and humane society. What better time than now, to become a part of the rebuilding of New Orleans - one of America's most unique cities - while gaining one of the best college educations in the world? \r\n\r\nFinally, take advantage of all the wonderful opportunities that Xavier provides you.  Higher education is not only about gaining intellectual knowledge, but acquiring social and community skills as well.  Extra-curricular activities are a great way to meet new people, find your place, and to create wonderful memories of your time here. At Xavier we offer a wide array of clubs, organizations and teams to suit the needs and interests of the student body.  Some of these clubs include:  Peer Dean Association, Commuter Student Association, Xavier Activities Board, Jazz Band, NAACP, Men's and Women's Basketball, Business Achievers Club, MAX (Mobilization at Xavier) and the PanHellenic Council. Get involved, make new friends, create wonderful memories, but most of all, have fun!"

With 4,600 full-time students, York is a rare breed: an ideally-sized private college. \r\n\r\nBut does size really make a difference? Incoming freshman think so: it's their #1 reason for choosing York. York is small enough to maintain its strong student focus. Classes are small. Students build close relationships with faculty and enjoy one-on-one advising and counseling. You won't find that at a big state school, certainly not at the undergraduate level. Yet, York is large enough to provide much more extensive resources than you find at most small colleges. Our campus facilities are fantastic - come see for yourself. You'll also find York offers a breadth of extra-curricular activities that small colleges rarely provide. \r\n\r\nWe're also a private institution, so we enjoy the independence to seize opportunities whenever they happen. As a result, York College has been transformed, and is transforming still. Over the past three years we have built new state-of-the-art facilities like the Grumbacher Sport and Fitness Center, Humanities Center, Engineering Innovation Center, and Performing Arts Center. A new 360 bed residence and dining facility, major renovations for Biological Sciences, Behavioral Sciences, Education, and Business are currently in the works.\r\n\r\nMost people agree that first impressions matter.

            "Located in Montana's state capital of Helena, Carroll College is the Northwest's leading, four-year, Catholic liberal arts and pre-professional college. With 1,450 students and an average of 13 students for each professor, Carroll offers an affordable, student-centered education with proven results. Carroll graduates are highly prized in the professional job market and are accepted to the nation's best medical, law and graduate schools, with some of the highest per capita admission rates in the nation. Among Carroll's academic achievements: 84 percent of Carroll pre-med students applying to medical school are accepted (the national average is 50 percent); Carroll graduates pass the CPA exam at a rate that is three times the national average; and 90 percent of Carroll nursing majors pass their national professional examinations on their first attempt. While still in their undergraduate years, Carroll natural science students have discovered more than 10 new species. In national competition, Carroll also wins high honors. Carroll's Fighting Saints football team has won five NAIA championships in the past six years, all while maintaining a record number of nationally recognized scholar-athletes. The Carroll Talking Saints forensics team, a training ground for future attorneys, public servants and business professionals, is ranked in the top three of all colleges and universities of all sizes nationwide and has reigned as the Northwest regional champion for the past 18 years. Carroll's faculty members are consistently recognized for their excellence, earning Fulbright Scholarships and awards for leadership and scholarship in their fields. In the sciences, Carroll professors and their students perform groundbreaking research across the globe and publish in a variety of disciplines, from the hard sciences to history. During the 2009-2010 celebration of the college's centennial, Carroll College is launching a variety of new majors, centers of study and facility changes to enhance the student learning experience.  The addition of more natural science majors, laboratories and further emphasis on the college's environmental studies and pre-law programs are occurring now. A Center for Peace and Social Justice will build on the college's tradition of educating students for service to the human family both locally and abroad. Carroll's Human-Animal Bond Program, the first of its kind in the nation, educates students to train dogs and horses as service and therapy animals. Service and an examination of social justice issues are hallmarks of a Catholic higher education. Carroll's focus on service and social justice takes many forms, starting in the freshman year with Alpha Seminar's study of a social problem and taking action to solve it. Service learning in and out of the classroom continues for Carroll students throughout their undergraduate experience, with almost every Carroll undergraduate choosing some sort of volunteer activity in service to the human family. Because of its small size and philosophy of respecting all people, Carroll's campus life is fun, welcoming and constantly exciting. Activities on campus offer something for everyone: concerts, dances, intramural sports, more than 40 clubs, theater, campus newspaper, college radio, choir, films, athletic events, Campus Ministry Fellowship, and more. National speakers regularly appear on campus, and outstanding cultural events are available to students throughout the year."

            "In 1841, settlers living in the Wisconsin Territory community of Prairieville established the academy that five years later would become Carroll College. Soon after its founding, Carroll affiliated with the Presbyterian Church and adopted the motto, \"Christo et Litteris,\" which means \"for Christ and Learning.\" The college???s early patrons believed that higher education would serve as an instrument for civilizing the wilderness, spreading the Gospel and planting the roots of democracy deep in the prairie soil. They also sought to provide for the prosperity of their children and future generations. As \r\nWisconsin???s oldest institution of higher learning, Carroll is known today as the \"Pioneer College.\" Throughout its history, the Carroll educational experience has been marked by teaching excellence and individualized attention. Today, 162 years after the college???s founding, these values continue to anchor a superior education geared to ensure students??? success in the 21st century. The college???s educational philosophy is sustained by the four pillars of integrated knowledge, lifelong skills, gateway experiences and enduring values. Integrated Knowledge is the very foundation of a quality liberal arts program. The Carroll curriculum emphasizes breadth and depth of learning. Our purpose is to encourage students to recognize the interrelationships among ideas. We believe that students with this understanding will continue to learn, grow and succeed long after they leave the campus. Lifelong Skills help students prepare for life and work in a world of rapid and constant change. We believe that graduates will continue to evolve and contribute to their communities long after they earn their degrees. To that end, our mission is to help students learn to think critically and creatively, adapt to changing technologies, work efficiently and effectively, collaborate with others, and communicate clear, compelling ideas. Enduring Values help students to consider always the impact of their actions on the world around them. We believe that effective leaders draw their inspiration from strong personal value systems. Our goal, therefore, is to offer students multiple opportunities to make decisions and then to reflect upon their consequences. Gateway Experiences occur both upon entering and upon leaving Carroll College. We believe that our educational responsibility extends beyond the classroom into every aspect of our students??? lives. That is why we place a special emphasis on preparing incoming students for college life and on helping graduates make successful transitions into their first jobs, or graduate and professional schools. The four pillars undergird all that we do at Carroll College. They are integral to our undergraduate curriculum and guide our post-baccalaureate and graduate programs. They provide the broad inspiration for the Carroll experience and the many relationships we nurture with other organizations and institutions. An education at Carroll College offers a student alternatives from which to choose a worthwhile personal, professional and civic life. It promotes intellectual growth that culminates in the capacity for serious and creative thinking. Based on a core of studies in the liberal arts and sciences, complemented by career preparation and co-curricular programs, a Carroll education encourages growth in international and cultural awareness, social responsibility, moral sensitivity and spiritual reflection. A Carroll education begins with the acquisition of fundamental skills and bodies of knowledge. These skills include critical inquiry, effective communication, aesthetic understanding, quantitative reasoning and the capacities to gather and assimilate information and to identify and solve problems. The most essential consequence of a Carroll education is that students develop their capacity and desire to continue learning."

            "Case Western Reserve University is known for its world class research, but with more than 150 student organizations, there are plenty of opportunities to get involved outside the classroom, too. About three fourths of the active student body play intramural sports, and the Case Western Spartans varsity teams compete in the Division III University Athletic Association. The Greek system, which stresses a commitment to on-campus and community service, involves about one third of students. The campus is located about 20 minutes from downtown Cleveland, where students have free access to a handful of downtown museums like the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Great Lakes Science Center. On campus, freshmen live in one of three themed residential communities, which are called Cedar, Juniper, and Mistletoe. All students are invited to the annual SpringFest, a collection of music, carnival games, and activities that is the largest student-run event on campus."

            "The Catholic University of America is unique as the national university of the Catholic Church, with the added distinction that all undergraduates combine a base curriculum in the liberal arts with more in-depth courses from their major fields of study. \r\nPrivate and coeducational, CUA has 12 schools, eight of which award undergraduate degrees--architecture and planning, arts and sciences, engineering, music, nursing, philosophy, professional studies, and social work. All 12 schools grant graduate degrees. Catholic University's student body is almost evenly divided between undergraduate and graduate students, totaling approximately 6,800. The university was founded in 1887 as a graduate institution. That foundation offers today's undergraduates unique opportunities to conduct scholarly and scientific research in their fields of study, working closely with faculty. Recent additions to the graduate offerings include a master of science degree in business analysis for nonbusiness majors, as well as master's of science programs in nuclear environmental protection, biotechnology, and materials science and engineering for those with undergraduate degrees in science looking to enter those lucrative fields. \r\nCUA undergraduates begin their academic career with First Year Experience, which introduces them to philosophy, theology, rhetoric and logic through study in small, supportive learning communities. This coursework engages them in thinking about, discussing and writing about the great questions that have shaped human history and that continue to confront us today. \r\nStudents have unique opportunities to address those questions worldwide through CUA's education abroad programs. Students in all majors can find semester, yearlong, or summer-only opportunities for study on every continent in the world. Politics majors can choose internships in the British or Irish houses of parliament, or the European Parliament or Commission. Architecture students can study the marvelous buildings of Barcelona, Rome or Paris, or, in the school's award-winning Spirit of Place/Spirit of Design course, engage in a design/build project that begins in the studio and ends building a project in remote locations in such countries as Peru, Ireland and Finland, in affiliation with anthropology, archeology, environment and the arts. Students in engineering can fulfill some of their academic requirements in exciting Hong Kong at Polytechnic University. Nursing majors can learn valuable intercultural lessons at Australian Catholic University as well as take part in mission trips to Central America over the summer and on spring break. \r\nThrough Campus Ministry, CUA students also embark on mission trips to Central America and Jamaica and in the nation's capital serve poor, elderly, homeless or otherwise disadvantaged people through homeless food runs, work with Jeanne Jugan Little Sisters of the Poor and St. Ann's Infant and Maternity Home, and volunteering with So Others Might Eat. The university's long history in Washington, D.C., offers CUA students an incredible range of cultural and professional opportunities, most accessible from the D.C. Metrorail system, which is adjacent to campus. In fact, students at the university have the best of both worlds: they study and live on the largest campus in D.C.--193 acres--where they can enjoy a complete collegiate experience, but they are also located in the heart of the nation's capital, five minutes Metrorail ride from Capitol Hill, the Smithsonian Institution, Supreme Court, Library of Congress and Union Station. In short, students from around the United States and 97 foreign countries find CUA's academic offerings, Catholic foundation, stunning campus, and extensive off-campus opportunities make it a desirable educational destination."

Nearly 30 campus-based courses have service-learning components, 200-250 students each semester engage in course-based service-learning with up to 70 community partners, and all of Central???s study-abroad programs have service-learning options for students.  Central has been recognized repeatedly in the President???s Honor Roll of Distinguished Service-Learning Programs.  \r\nFrom renovations, to new construction, to recycling, Central is committed to advancing a holistic and integrated worldview of sustainability by developing a greener campus.  The newly constructed Roe Center, housing education, psychology, communications, community-based learning, and the Center for Global Sustainability Education, opened in August 2009 and recently received the state???s first platinum Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating from the U.S. Green Building.  In 2003, the Vermeer Science Center was recognized as the first building in Iowa to achieve a silver LEED rating, and Howard McKee Hall was the first residential building in the state to receive a gold LEED rating.  Sustainability efforts extend across campus from dining services (organic foods) to student-led recycling efforts.   The newly created Center for Global Sustainability Education serves as a resource center and community sustainability partner which works in conjunction with the community-based learning program. \r\n\r\nApproximately 30 percent of the campus population is involved in the fine arts.  Students can sing or play in one of 18 ensembles ranging from classical to jazz to pop.  Music ensembles have toured Italy, Paris, British Columbia, London and New York; Central features the only undergraduate glass blowing studio in the state of Iowa; the Mills Gallery showcases art exhibitions throughout the year.  Theatre programs involve students in every facet of stage production with an intense schedule of three or four major productions annually.  The Geisler Library Writers Reading Series includes visits from nationally known authors reading from their fiction and non-fiction works.  Supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities and Humanities Iowa, recent guests have included Marilynn Robinson, Ted Kooser, Carol Bly, Jane Hirshfield, Richard Powers, and Patricia Hampl.\r\n\r\nApproximately 50 percent of all undergraduates participate in Central???s NCAA Division III program.   Athletics are integral to the college???s overall mission in which development of the whole person is essential.  Central student-athletes have received ESPN Academic All-American distinction 46 times and won NCAA Postgraduate scholarships 20 times.  Central???s Kuyper Athletics Complex is one of the top collegiate facilities in the region, having been chosen to host more NCAA championship events in more sports than any other Iowa college."

With offerings ranging from high-school dual credit to graduate studies and a total enrollment of more than 4,500, its liberal arts and pre-professional programs are centered on a character core that has twice brought Central Methodist national recognition for its leadership in character education.  In recent years the University has attracted significant challenge grants from the national Kresge and Mabee Foundations to help build a $15 million Student and Community Center on the academic quadrangle and to fund $5 million in major upgrades to its athletic facilities."

            "Central Washington University's mission is to prepare students for responsible citizenship, responsible stewardship of the earth, and enlightened and productive lives.  Faculty, staff, students, and alumni serve as an intellectual resource to assist central Washington, the state, and the region in solving human and environmental problems.\r\n\r\nQualified faculty and staff create a community that encourages and supports the emotional, personal, and professional growth of students from a variety of backgrounds. The university works with community colleges to establish centers throughout the state and employs technology to extend the reach of its educational programs.\r\n\r\nThe university community values teaching as the vehicle to inspire intellectual depth and breadth, to encourage lifelong learning, and to enhance the opportunities of its students. The faculty develop and strengthen bachelor's and master's degree programs in the arts, sciences, and humanities; in teacher education; in business; in the social services; and in technological specializations. A strong liberal arts foundation; applied emphases; opportunities for undergraduate research, creative expression, and international study; and close working relationships between students and faculty are hallmarks of the undergraduate experience. Graduate programs develop partnerships between faculty and students to extend scholarship to important areas of research and practice.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, President Jerilyn McIntyre introduced the \"spheres of distinction\" initiative, an initiative that supports innovative and resourceful approaches to academic, student, and campus life giving regional, national, or international prominence to Central Washington University.  Members of the campus community are invited to submit proposals for projects in one of five categories including:\r\n\r\n- Interdisciplinary Programs and Research\r\n- Preparation of Professional Educators\r\n- Programs and Activities Nurturing the Development of Students as Individuals, Scholars, Artists, and Citizens\r\n- Activities Addressing Regional Needs and Enhancing Regional Resources\r\n- University Centers (Six CWU centers located on the campuses of community colleges that provide access to upper division, baccalaureate and master's degree programs.)\r\n\r\nPriority is given to projects that are interdisciplinary and interdivisional.  This very successful initiative has garnered more than 60 proposals during its first two years from which 22  projects have been funded. Funded projects include, among others, the CWU Interdisciplinary Carbon Reduction and Energy Studies Initiative, the American Indian Studies Program,  and the Science Talent Expansion Program (STEP).  Through this directed funding, Central Washington University has been able to expand and nurture areas of excellence on the campus."

            "For students who attend Centre College, three things are definite: If they want, they will be able to study abroad, complete an internship, and graduate in four years. The school, located in Danville, Ky., guarantees that all students who follow academic and social guidelines will be exposed to each of the three key college experiences. Many students choose to partake in the Centre Commitment, as it is called; for example, more than 85 percent study abroad at least one time. Never traveled outside the country? Centre College will buy a passport for every student who doesn’t have one. Back in Danville, students can check out more than 100 clubs on campus. About 40 percent of students join the school’s popular Greek system, which has a handful of  fraternities and sororities. Student athletes can play for the Centre Colonels, varsity teams that compete in the NCAA Division III Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference. There are dozens of performances, from ballets to book readings, on campus each semester, and all full-time students must attend at least 12 per year. All students must live on campus, unless they commute from a parent’s home nearby or are married. A limited number of seniors who apply to move off campus will be permitted to do so. All students are allowed to have cars, which is a good thing for outdoor enthusiasts; without venturing far from campus, students can play frisbee golf at Henry Jackson Park, canoe at Cummins Falls Marina, or explore the Central Kentucky Wildlife Refuge. Longer car trips will take students to Lexington, Ky., in 40 minutes; Cincinnati in two hours; and Nashville, Tenn., in 3.5 hours."

            "Chatham University prepares students from around the world to develop solutions to some of the world's biggest challenges. Every Chatham student -- women in Chatham's historic women's residential college, and men and women in Chatham's graduate programs -- receives a highly individualized, experiential educational experience that is informed by Chatham's strong institutional commitment to globalism, the environment and citizen leadership. Founded in 1869, Chatham University includes the Shadyside Campus, with Chatham Eastside and the historic 39-acre Woodland Road arboretum; and the 388-acre Eden Hall Campus north of Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nThe University consists of three distinctive Colleges: Chatham College for Women houses academic and co-curricular programs for undergraduate women and embodies the traditions and rituals of one of the nation's oldest colleges for women. The College for Graduate Studies offers women and men both master's and doctoral programs with concentrations in interior and landscape architecture, business, counseling psychology, film, health sciences, nursing, teaching, and writing.  The College for Continuing and Professional Studies provides online and hybrid undergraduate and graduate degree programs through the doctoral level for women and men, certificate programs, and community programming.  \r\n\r\nLocation and Environment\r\nChatham University is home to nearly 2,200 undergraduate and graduate students, both on campus and studying online around the world. Students' personal, professional, and leadership skills are developed to their fullest potential through internships, study abroad, service-learning and leadership training opportunities, and personal development seminars. All first-year students receive tablet computers which are integrated into coursework and provide access to a wireless campus network. The student-teacher ratio at Chatham College for Women is 10:1, which ensures greater interaction between students and faculty. All undergraduate faculty members hold terminal degrees in their respective fields.\r\n\r\nThe University's 4-4-1 academic calendar consists of fall and spring terms plus a three-week Maymester which features study abroad, concentrated study, experiential projects, travel and field experiences, internships, interdisciplinary study, and exchanges with other colleges abroad.\r\n\r\nAcademic Opportunities\r\nUndergraduate students may choose a traditional major, an interdisciplinary major, a double major, or a self-designed major. Pre-professional programs are offered in education with teaching certification, law, medicine and health professions, physical therapy, and veterinary medicine. Teacher certification is available through the education program in early childhood, elementary, environmental, school counseling, special education, and secondary education. \r\n\r\nThe Accelerated Graduate Program allows undergraduates to apply to one of the University's graduate programs during her junior year, and thereby earn both a bachelor's and master's degree in as few as five years.  Chatham also offers an Accelerated Graduate Program with the H. John Heinz III School of Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University. \r\n\r\nOff-Campus Opportunities\r\nChatham's undergraduate and graduate students can access Pittsburgh's dynamic career, cultural, and entertainment opportunities. Students may cross-register with any of eight other colleges and universities, including Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.\r\n \r\nExtra-curricular learning and service are also important components to a Chatham education. Most students complete at least two internships or career-related experiences in their fields. Chatham Abroad, a multi-week travel experience with classmates and faculty, has taken students to Belize, Galapagos Islands, Morocco, Egypt, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, England, Russia, Norway, Iceland, Greece, and Haiti."

            "The Mission of Chestnut Hill College is to provide students with holistic education in an inclusive Catholic community marked by academic excellence, shared responsibility, personal and professional growth, service to one another and to the global community, and concern for the earth. Chestnut Hill College is a close-knit community offering personalized one-on-one contact between faculty and students. The college is growing: two new buildings have been constructed in the past five years, and land has recently been acquired that almost doubles our campus size. A unique collaborative opportunity is the Sisters of St. Joseph Association of Colleges Student Exchange Program (ACSSJ), which offers students the opportunity to study at one of seven other U.S. colleges sponsored by the Sisters of St. Joseph. The College is a member of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Consortium for Higher Education (SEPCHE), a consortium of eight independent higher education institutions in the Greater Philadelphia region. Positive outcomes for students include extensive course offerings through cross registration plus the richness of sharing in the resources of seven excellent colleges. Our campus location combines the best of center city of Philadelphia, only a short train ride away; the charm of colonial Chestnut Hill, just up the hill; and the sylvan beauty of Fairmount Park, directly across the street. Chestnut Hill College was founded in 1924 as a Catholic, four-year, liberal arts college for women and opened its full-time undergraduate program to men in the Fall of 2003. Since its inception, the  College has offered a rigorous liberal arts education that provides students with a broad background in the humanities, social sciences,and naturals sciences. The College has a history of preparing students for careers in the sciences and education and has developed a strong technology focus. Chestnut Hill College prepares students for life's challenges by helping them to grow intellectually, spiritually, emotionally, and socially."

There are more than 325 student clubs and organizations, and about 25 percent of students are involved in the school’s large Greek system. Clemson is set on Hartwell Lake, where students can sail, swim, and fish. For indoor fun, the on-campus Union Recreation Center has a bowling alley, arcade, and billiards room. Students can travel for free on campus bus system The CAT, which connects students between Clemson University and the nearby city of Clemson, S.C.. The city of Clemson is within walking distance of campus, too, and offers a typical active college scene with many shopping, dining, and nightlife options. Freshmen must live in university housing, and nearly half of all students choose to live on the school’s picturesque, tree-lined campus."

Many classes actually take place at a round table and even in regular classes the constant interaction between professors and students is a hallmark of Coker's learning experience. The frequent occasions when students engage each other in classroom discussion also provide peer support in the learning process.

Today's programs mirror the college's place in history as an institution that anticipates and meets contemporary needs with a visionary and pragmatic education.  The new School of Pharmacy, welcoming its inaugural class in fall 2009, is the first Pharmacy program in the country offered at a women's college.

            "The only women's college in a five-state Midwestern region, College of Saint Mary (CSM) in the heart of Omaha, Nebraska is a Catholic college dedicated to the education of women in an environment that calls forth potential and fosters leadership. College of Saint Mary offers thirty programs of study, including courses in subjects as far ranging as education, nursing, applied psychology, forensic science, and women's studies, with divisions in professional studies, arts and sciences, and health professions. Since 1923, CSM has remained dedicated to its original mission: the education of women for leadership, service and success. While CSM is committed to undergraduate education, graduate programs in education, the health professions, and organizational leadership enable professionals in the area to reach their career and personal goals while still working full-time. College of Saint Mary offers innovative programs unavailable elsewhere in the region. A specially designed residence hall, Mothers Living and Learning, allows over thirty single mothers and their children to live on campus while the mother pursues her degree. Education students directly teach at-risk children while learning to instruct math and science effectively in our Operation SMART program, a partnership with Girls, Inc. of Omaha. An agreement with the Peter Kiewit Institute encourages women studying math and science at CSM to enter into the engineering profession. This \"2 + 3\" program allows a CSM student to receive a CSM bachelor's degree in Math or Science and a Master's Degree from the University of Nebraska in engineering in just five years. Over 90% of CSM students receive financial aid, and CSM has several unique scholarship programs. Through donor support, the McAuley Scholarship program provides full tuition and fees for fifteen women at any one time who are currently receiving public assistance, such as food stamps or housing subsidies, offering a true \"hand up\" from welfare. The Marie Curie Scholars Program, funded by a generous grant from the National Science Foundation, provides significant financial support for academically talented, but financially challenged, students who plan to study Biology, Chemistry, or Mathematics. Campus life is rich and exciting. CSM fields competitive NAIA teams in basketball, cross country, softball, volleyball, swimming, and soccer. Omaha's midtown development, Aksarben Village, is emerging just across the street from campus; soon students will be steps away from new restaurants, retail stores, and a movie theatre. Our Lied Fitness Center offers free, on campus workout facilities including a swimming pool, and the Keystone Trail and Papio Creek winds across the edge of campus, offering a beautiful place to run, walk or bike. In the classroom, students receive a high quality education that combines a liberal arts core with practical learning opportunities, career-specific skills, leadership development, and community service. Our service learning program sponsors annual winter, spring, and summer break trips where students travel to locations such as the U.S. Mexico border and Costa Rica to learn while serving. The remarkably low student-teacher ratio and benefits of an all-female setting offer the opportunity to be both challenged and empowered in the classroom. To women serious about attaining high achievement in all aspects of their lives, College of Saint Mary is a proven personal and professional launch pad that provides dynamic opportunities for leadership and personal growth within a uniquely supportive setting."

            "The College of Saint Rose is a private liberal arts college in the heart of Albany that instills students with the passion, knowledge and purpose, not only to do great things-but extraordinary things. By becoming engaged with the community, whether it is helping to jump start inner-city micro businesses or inspiring at-risk kids to pursue science and math, Saint Rose students learn of their role as citizen-leaders. Saint Rose hosts internationally renowned speakers, musicians and leaders so that our students are exposed to the exciting exchange of ideas & perspectives. Our own Jimmy Fallon, former Saturday Night Live comedian and now late night star, will return to accept his B.A. in communications which he completed through the College's Experienced Adult program to address the class of 2009 along with pollster John Zogby. With professors who are recognized scholars in their fields and an average class size of 20, students develop mentoring relationships that last long after graduation. 66 undergraduate programs ranging from the humanities to education, mathematics and sciences to business, provides many choices and accelerated dual degrees enable students to complete both their undergraduate and graduate degrees in five years. This values-based education goes hand-in-hand with the kind of highly credentialed faculty and seminar-style classes often found in colleges double or triple the cost of Saint Rose. With one of the lowest private college tuitions in the entire northeast and more than $23 million in scholarships and grants awarded in 2009, Saint Rose is a remarkable educational experience at a price families can afford. Recent Saint Rose graduates are employed at numerous schools, colleges & companies, including the American Red Cross, Astra-Zeneca, Centers for Disease Control, DreamWorks, IBM, Houghton-Mifflin, Lehman Brothers, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Hallmark Corp., Hearst Newspapers, KPMG, MTV Networks, NBC,and VH-1 Network. Many students pursue graduate study at prestigious universities including Carnegie Mellon University, Columbia University, Dartmouth Medical School, Duke Medical School, Georgetown Law School, Harvard, Notre Dame, NYU, Tufts Medical School and Yale University. The most significant of the ongoing investments we are making this year is the construction of the Center for Communications and Interactive Media scheduled for completion in January of 2010. A 20,000 square foot facility will house new TV & radio studios, a live recording studio, video and film viewing room, multimedia computer labs and offices for the College's communications & music industry faculty. When completed, it will join the Massry Center for the Arts and the Campus Theatre to form an arts and communications section of the campus. Perhaps the clearest commitment to the cultural life of the City of Albany, the construction of the $14 million Massry Center for the Arts completed in September. Within the Massry Center's 46,000 square feet of wireless & smart classrooms, practice & performance space, music students experience the finest sound quality as they rehearse & perform a wide variety of orchestral & choral works. Designed with state-of-the-art acoustical technology features, a 400-seat performance hall, acoustically congruent but separate instrumental and choral rehearsal suites, applied teaching studios & piano keyboard laboratories. The College is also investing more than $2.5 million in land it is leasing from the City of Albany to create a home turf for the College's outdoor athletic programs. The Joe Plumeri Sports Complex will feature an NCAA level baseball field, softball field and an artificial turf soccer/lacrosse field as well as a natural grass practice field. These fields will be the home fields for the Saint Rose Golden Knights, who have regularly won bids to NE-10 conference and Division II national tournaments and for intramural and club sports."

            "Located between the Atlantic Ocean and Acadia National Park, College of the Atlantic offers two degrees: a BA and MPhil, both in Human Ecology. In pursuit of this degree, students consult their individual passions to create their own academic trajectories, integrating knowledge from all academic disciplines and personal experience to fulfill the mission of Human Ecology: investigating and improving relationships between humans and our social, natural, built and virtual communities. COA's small size and individualized curriculum encourages tutorials, intensive seminar-style classes, shared committee involvement and frequent faculty-student interchanges, which are as common in the college's one dining room as during faculty office hours. As one student said, \"Learning at COA is fulltime.\" Having one major means that COA has no departments and no departmental requirements; classes are interdisciplinary. Coursework consists of readings, usually from primary sources, and active investigation. These efforts culminate in a term-long senior project required of every graduate. As part of coursework and/or senior projects, recent students have represented their nation, or the entirety of the world's youth in international meetings on climate change, investigated the impact of big box stores (resulting in first-in-the-nation legislation for Maine), used GIS maps to educate local towns on impending planning decisions, and prepared an emergency system for a California town, written novels, conducted surveys of amphibians in the Maine north woods and of plant species in Acadia National Park, conducted independent research on bird habitat on an offshore island, written autobiographies and new curricula, created CDs, restored a major on-campus garden, built a pollinator-friendly meadow, designed homes, constructed windmills, created photography and ethnography books and exhibitions - and more. Beyond this, COA is a democratic institution, with students involved on all levels of governance and a weekly campus meeting to discuss current campus issues and decisions. Major decisions must be brought to this All-College Meeting; committees that filter into the governance structure include participation by students. Opportunities for travel abound; students must complete a one-term internship, which usually takes them off-campus and often abroad. The college offers a residency term in Mexico and another in France. International connections on campus are extensive, as COA has one of the highest percentages of international students of any liberal arts college. Many students come to COA with a desire to change the world - and leave with the tools to do so. COA practices what it teaches - and teaches what it practices; it is the first college to become carbon neutral; new student residences are outfitted with composting toilets; the kitchen serves food from the college's organic farm. Now, COA offers one of the very few undergraduate green and socially responsible business programs, and provides seniors with entrepreneurial interests a yearlong mentorship opportunity for their business. It also offers a Food Systems Program that connects COA's organic farm to an organic research center in the United Kingdom and a graduate school in Germany. A degree in human ecology means that knowledge from the arts, sciences and humanities are valued and applied by faculty and students helping to shape a more sustainable, just and balanced world."

            "Worcester, Mass., is the second-largest city in New England and a booming college town to boot. The College of the Holy Cross is one of 13 institutions in the area, so students have a variety of dining, nightlife, and outdoor options. Boston, another thriving college town, is 45 miles away. On the Holy Cross campus, students can choose from about 100 clubs and organizations in which to get involved. There is no Greek system at the Jesuit institution. All freshmen students must live on campus and must participate in the Montserrat program, which clusters together small groups of first-year students who take the same classes, live in the same themed residence areas, and engage in group activities. Close to 90 percent of students live on campus. A quarter of students play varsity sports in the NCAA Division I Patriot League. The costumed school mascot is known as the Crusader, the same name the sports teams take. Students can elect to study for a semester in another country, at another school, or in Washington, D.C. As the nation’s only Jesuit institution solely for undergraduates, Holy Cross offers spiritual activities and retreats throughout the school year. The student body is predominantly Catholic, but all faiths are welcome."

            "At Colorado College, the typical semester does not exist. Instead of taking a full courseload like students at most other schools, CC students take one class every three-and-a-half weeks through the school’s Block Plan. Classes are small and, with no designated end time, can run as long as a teacher needs. Each month, students get a four-and-a-half day Block Break to recharge before starting a new course. In total, students will take eight classes a year. When not in class, students can experience all the Colorado landscape has to offer. CC is located in Colorado Springs at the base of Pikes Peak, where students can hike, bike, and climb. In addition, the student Outdoor Recreation Committee facilitates excursions such as backpacking, cross-country skiing, kayaking, and ice climbing. On campus, students can partake in annual events like the Winter Ball, a formal dance, and CC Llamapalooza, a music festival. Volunteerism is another student body focus: All first-year students complete a four-day service trip before freshman year, and students run an on-campus soup kitchen for the local poor on Sundays. CC has a small Greek community with one fraternity and three sororities. CC has a Division I women’s soccer and men’s hockey team; all other CC Tiger teams compete in the NCAA Division III Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference. Most students stay close to the many on-campus activities at CC because freshmen, sophomores, and juniors must live in university residence facilities."

            "For left-brained students who want to work in the sciences, opportunities abound at the Colorado School of Mines. A public engineering and applied sciences school in Golden, Colo., Mines has 21 academic departments including Hydrologic Science and Engineering and Geophysics. The school also offers degrees in Liberal Arts & International Studies and Economics & Business departments. When students aren’t studying, the school’s location is ideal for outdoor recreation. Golden is 13 miles from the state capital of Denver, and lies in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, where students can bike, hike, and climb. The campus also has a fake rock wall for students to test their skills before attempting the Rockies. Cold-weather sports fans can partake in the annual Winter Carnival, a student-run affair packed with skiing and snowboarding at a local resort. The Mines sports teams, known as the Orediggers, compete in the NCAA Division II Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference, which is mostly comprised of other teams from Colorado. The school mascot is Blaster the burro, and a giant ‘M’ emblazoned onto nearby Mount Zion signifies the school spirit. There are more than 140 student clubs and organizations, including seven fraternities and three sororities. First-year students do not have to live on campus, though about 90 percent opt to do so. Even the student newspaper,", 
            ", is decidedly science based; sections include weekly roundups of new discoveries and a Geek of the Week feature."

            "Concordia University, Nebraska is a place where you can find your heart's calling and be equipped to answer it. Here, the foundation of our Christian Lutheran university is evident in the professor who cares about the whole student, the community who gathers for worship together and the roommates who support each other in successes and challenges. It is impossible to walk across campus and not be greeted; it is impossible to simply get lost in the crowd. And while those professors do care, they are also demanding and have developed rigorous programs that will effectively ready you for your calling and prepare you to lead with your heart. The variety of programs lets you arrive at Concordia willing to explore a bit and settle on a course of study that you are passionate about pursuing. An overwhelming majority of our graduates find employment immediately after graduation. Since we started as a teacher's college that might not be surprising for our education majors, but the same is true with our business, science, pre-professional and health graduates. Now, someone might think that an education of this quality in such a supportive atmosphere is a financial impossibility. Between scholarships, grants, aid from individual organizations and churches and loans, 98 percent of Concordia students are supported throughout their education. And those scholarships are not just available for outstanding athletes or brilliant academics, but artists, musicians and actors, too. Of course, maybe you are an athlete and you want to play. Not a problem. Our 18 intercollegiate teams form tight-knit communities to compete (and win!) all over the country. Our GPAC conference is tough, and those worthy opponents will prepare you for regional and national competition as well. Concordia is also a place where that teammate on the track team may also be an award-winner for their graphic design work or a volleyball player may also solo on the national choir tour. And both of them might be on the Student Activities Council, work on the newspaper or be part of Students In Free Enterprise. Opportunities abound as you follow your heart to Concordia University, Nebraska."

            "For students at Connecticut College, “if you want to do it, it can be done,” according to the school’s website. There are more than 60 clubs and organizations, and students with a creative idea can start their own group, too. Students can have plenty of fun at the school’s annual events, like Festivus, a campus-wide celebration and dance named for the Seinfeld-created holiday, and HarvestFest, a day of autumnal activities. Other events throughout the year aim to create a spirited rivalry among the residence halls—whether it’s during the Camelympics, a weekend-long event of athletic competitions and a dance party, or the Spring Camel Cabaret, a talent show competition. These events involve almost everyone at Connecticut College, because all undergraduates are expected to live on campus. There is no Greek life on campus, but students can kick off each weekend early with TNEs, or Thursday Night Events, which are activities sponsored by rotating organizations, classes, and residence halls. On Fridays, students can venture to into the college’s town of New London for the weekly Friday Nights in the District, during which shops and galleries stay open late. The school has 28 varsity sports teams and is a member of the Division III New England Small College Athletic Conference. The school mascot is a camel, and student fans can attend any sporting event for free. For entertainment of the creative variety, there are more than a dozen performing arts centers scattered across campus that host student and professional shows throughout the year. Floralia, a day of musical concerts, is held each spring in an on-campus amphitheater. Creative arts are a big focus at Connecticut College, and every student must take at least one creative class before graduation."

            "Cornell College is recognized as one of the nation's finest and most distinctive liberal arts colleges, offering its students one extraordinary opportunity after another, in the classroom, on campus, and around the world. Cornell is able to provide distinctive learning experiences, which many institutions simply cannot duplicate, through its innovative One Course At A Time (OCAAT) academic calendar. Also referred to as the block plan, OCCAT enables students to immerse themselves in a single course of study, each year taking eight to nine different courses during three-and-one-half week terms, or blocks. Students have as much, if not more, classroom time on OCAAT as on a traditional semester calendar but benefit from both the focus and flexibility afforded by OCAAT. Faculty also only teach one course at a time so that they establish close relationships with their students. Cornell's student-faculty ratio of 11:1 enables its faculty to provide students with personalized attention, and classes are capped at 25 students with an average of 16. Faculty are able to creatively design seminar-style courses that can explore the integration of theory and practice, traveling freely off-campus without the competing demands of a semester calendar. Founded in 1853, Cornell's historic hilltop campus is the home of an attractively diverse student body of 1,200 who come from 47 states and 20 countries. Cornell students are intellectually curious, achievement-oriented, fun-loving, and service-minded.  They are actively involved in campus life, whether in arts, athletics, student government, or special interest groups. Since all classes are on a standard schedule, students are able to pursue their extracurricular interests with the same passion they pursue their coursework. Cornell is a residential campus contributing to a strong sense of community.  The college offers highly successful pre-professional programs in business, education, law, and medicine as well as dual degree programs in architecture and engineering. Pre-medical (and other pre-health professional) students pursue distinctive courses, research opportunities, and internships, as well as other services, through Dimensions: The Center for the Science and Culture of Healthcare. The Berry Center for Economics, Business, and Public Policy provides similar advantages for students interested in finance, entrepreneurship, and public policy issues. The Center for Teaching and Learning provides learning support for all students through writing, quantitative reasoning, and media studios. Cornell's pre-law program offers LSAT preparation, professional mentors, internships, and an outstanding mock trial program. Students who wish to study abroad may do so for a single block or a full semester through Cornell courses or the college's two international study consortia. Cornell graduates offer prospective employers and graduate schools exciting resumes of accomplishments, internships, and special study experiences. Two-thirds of Cornell graduates earn advanced degrees. Loren Pope, author of Looking Beyond the Ivy League and Colleges that Change Lives, wrote of Cornell College: \"In my book there is no better college, and it produces much more than its share of writers, scholars, and executives.\""

            "Founded in 1930, Brooklyn College is one of the eleven senior colleges of the City University of New York.  The College has been consistently ranked for the past six years by Princeton Review as among America???s Best Value Colleges.  In Princeton Review's 2009 guidebook, The Best 368 Colleges, Brooklyn College was ranked third in the nation for diversity. Located in what many consider to be the most culturally vibrant borough in the city, Brooklyn College is a comprehensive liberal arts institution with nationally recognized programs and world-class faculty in the arts and sciences, education, and business.  The student body reflects the city???s rich ethnic and cultural diversity and global connections. The college has continued to raise entrance requirements, supports vibrant honors programs and numerous student research opportunities, and provides robust and ongoing advisement for all students. The College enrolls more than 16,000 undergraduate and graduate students.  Over the last eight years, the college has appointed some 273 new full-time faculty members, more than half of its full-time teaching faculty, who hold higher degrees from Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Oxford, and similarly prestigious universities. Among them are Pulitzer Prize-winners, Fulbright and Guggenheim Fellows, and national grant researchers.  What attracts students to the College are its innovative programs, strong internship opportunities, and extensive study-abroad selections.  The College's admissions criteria are increasingly selective, and high-achieving high school students apply in ever-larger numbers for admission to the Macaulay Honors College at Brooklyn College, where they join other strong students who make up the College's prestigious Honors Academy, a federation of six honors programs.  Perhaps the best measure of an excellent college is the success of its students. The College ranks nineteenth nationally in the number of undergraduates who have gone on to receive Ph.D.'s. The Core Curriculum is the College's signature program. Long a national model, it was revised and strengthened in 2006 and offers students an unrivaled general education.  The On-Course Advantage (TOCA) enables dedicated students to graduate in the traditional four years by giving them priority at registration, guaranteed access to required courses, and one-on-one advising throughout their course of study. Brooklyn College is a student-centered campus; it has expanded its Center for Academic Advisement and Student Success in order to make individual, pro-active advising available to everyone. As a public institution, Brooklyn College takes seriously its public responsibilities. It has actively broadened its engagement with the surrounding neighborhood and with Brooklyn's cultural and social organizations and is most proud of its partnership with high schools throughout the borough. A major capital construction and renovation program is currently in progress at Brooklyn College, more than $500 million allocated to the College by New York State in capital funds. The West Quad Building, the first new building on campus since the 1970s, opened in fall 2009 and houses extensive student services and state-of-the-art physical education and athletic facilities. A new performing arts center is due to begin construction later this year, and a new science complex is on the drawing boards of well-known architectural firms."

Lehman faculty members are highly credentialed and include world-renowned scientists, an Oscar-winning composer and the 2001-2003 U.S. Poet Laureate.

Lehman's 37-acre campus is safe and beautiful.  Students pay the area's lowest tuition, but receive real value for their investment."

            "At its founding in 1937, Queens College was hailed by the people of the borough as \"the college of the future.\" Now part of  the City University of New York (CUNY), Queens College offers a rigorous education in the liberal arts and sciences under the guidance of a faculty dedicated to both teaching and research. Students graduate with the ability to think critically, address complex problems, explore various cultures, and use modern technologies and information resources. The college has one of the most diverse student populations in America, with students from more than 140 nations. A member of Phi Beta Kappa, Queens College was named one of the nation's hottest and most interesting colleges by the 2008 Kaplan/Newsweek How to Get into College guide. The guide especially praised the college for providing an exceptional education to talented people of all backgrounds and financial means, many of who are the first in their families to attend college. Located in a residential area of Flushing, Queens, America's most ethnically diverse county the beautiful campus consists of 77 acres lined with trees surrounding grassy open spaces and a traditional quad. The college boasts state-of-the-art computer and science laboratories, a spectacular music building, and the six-story Rosenthal Library. The major classroom building, Powdermaker Hall, is completely renovated with the latest technology throughout.  The administration is committed to making the college a home away from home for its students with over 100 clubs and teams, from the Science Organization of Minority Students to clubs for theatre, fencing, environmental science, and martial arts. The only CUNY college that participates in Division II sports, Queens sponsors men's and women's teams and has some of the finest athletics facilities in the metropolitan area.  The college continues to expand its wireless capability, open new cafes and dining areas, update the Student Union and other buildings, and embark on a variety of beautification projects to enhance students' experience on campus. Academic programs are organized into four divisions, which offer both day and evening courses: Arts and Humanities; Mathematics and the Natural Sciences; the Social Sciences; and Education (Queens College educates more teachers than any other college in New York City). The college offers over 100 undergraduate and graduate majors, including a Bachelor of Arts in Chinese, a Bachelor of Arts in Classics, Bachelor of Business Administration degree with majors in finance, international business, and actuarial studies, and new degree programs in Graphic Design, Neuroscience, and an MFA in Creative Writing. Queens College participates in two CUNY programs that offer students free tuition and other special benefits: Macaulay Honors College, a challenging program open to the most academically gifted students, and the Teacher Academy, an exciting teacher education program offered to academically strong students majoring in mathematics or one of the sciences. An Honors Center with lounges and labs was opened for students participating in the college's various honors programs. The college's centers and institutes serve students and the larger community by addressing society's most important challenges, including cancer, AIDS, pollution, and racism, as well as celebrating the borough's many ethnic communities. The College's arts scene is vibrant thanks to the new Kupferberg Center for the Visual and Performing Arts, which brings together the college's academic departments in the arts (Music, Drama, Art, and Media Studies), and its museums (the Godwin-Ternbach, the Queens College Art Center, and the Louis Armstrong House Museum). The celebrated Evening Readings Series has brought some of the world's finest writers to campus.  The College opened a new residence hall, The Summit, in Fall 2009, which houses approximately 500 students."

            "Dakota State University (DSU) is a public, non-profit institution that was established in 1881 as a \"normal school\", the first teacher education institution in Dakota Territory.  Today, DSU has been designated as South Dakota's information technology university and is a leader in integrating information technology into the academic disciplines of its curriculum.  Academic rigor and the infusion of information technology into teaching, research, creative activity and service are at the heart of the University's work.  As a result of the University's very focused mission, all academic programs -- even those that appear to be similar to programs elsewhere, such as English or biology - are a unique fusion of applied technology and discipline-specific courses.  To support its very focused, information technology mission, the University has a wired technology infrastructure (1 gigabyte to every desktop) overlayed with a wireless infrastructure that extends to all corners of the University campus, including the arena, the wellness center, and the football/track stadium.  The University implemented a wireless mobile computing initiative (WMCI) in 2004, which puts a tablet PC (currently a Fujitsu T4410) in the hands of all on-campus students.  Each classroom and campus meeting room includes a projection system that instructors, students, or meeting participants can access by logging into the University's wireless network and selecting that room's projector.  DSU's sports teams travel on specially equipped buses, so that students retain wireless access to their student accounts (email, web space and course management websites), even when they travel to out-of-town sports events.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to its pervasive, technology-rich infrastructure, Dakota State University prides itself in providing students with an open, friendly, safe, challenging, and collaborative environment.  The University encourages all students to participate in extra-curricular and co-curricular activities that enrich their academic experience - discipline-specific and personal interest clubs, sports, faculty-student research, and service learning, to name a few.  Its faculty and staff are high-quality, caring, and student-focused.  The institution is proud of its graduates and the exceptionally high job placement levels they achieve.\r\n\r\nDakota State University is recognized by both the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Department of Homeland Security as a National Center of Excellence in Information Assurance Education.  The University also includes a Center for Information Assurance in Banking and Finance, a Center for Advancement of Health Information Technology and a Center of Excellence in Computer Information Systems.\r\n\r\nDakota State University is accredited through the Higher Learning Commission of the North Center Association of Colleges and Schools as an AQIP (Academic Quality Improvement Program) institution.  Dakota State University's participation in AQIP accreditation reflects the institution's on-going commitment to organizational learning and institutional improvement.  At DSU, the AQIP accreditation process works in tandem and in harmony with the University's other continuous improvement processes, most notably its strategic planning processes, its institutional effectiveness processes, its program review processes and its assessment processes.  Its AQIP action projects provide a framework for improvement that focuses on data analysis and achievement of the University's publicly declared goals and objectives."

A \"culture of engagement\" melds the civic, academic, and cultural components of engagement into the student learning experience. Nationally recognized for its successful efforts to implement a model of civic engagement and service learning, Defiance is home to the McMaster School for Advancing Humanity, a unique research program serving as a focal point for teaching, service, scholarship, and action to improve the human condition worldwide. Through McMaster, undergraduate students regularly conduct original research in response to community-identified needs in high-need areas of the U.S. and the world. Student and faculty projects in domestic and international locations are supported by significant planning and research conducted by fellow students on campus. Students participated during 2009-10 in projects in Cambodia, Belize, New Orleans and Jamaica. Defiance's Citizen Leader Program provides $2,000 tuition scholarships for new students who demonstrate a record of service in their communities. Citizen Leaders who distinguish themselves as emerging leaders are invited to become Bonner Leaders. This leadership program provides students with opportunities to professionalize their leadership skills, and deepen their understanding and practice of community engagement and democratic practice. Freshmen in the Citizen Leader program are also invited to participate in the Hench Autism Studies Program, serving as peer mentors to high school-aged students with autism who are part of the on-campus HASP initiative. HASP, a collaboration of college and community resources, is a groundbreaking, multi-faceted program designed to specifically address the late adolescent years and the transition of individuals with autism to adulthood. Students and faculty, particularly in the social sciences, have opportunities to interact with the Family Justice Center of Northwest Ohio, one of a handful of centers nationwide that is a partnership of local government, community and nonprofit partners offering a coordinated response for victims of domestic violence and their children. Majors at Defiance College that appeal to 21st century students include forensic science, digital forensic science , and global and international studies. And, the College recently led a collaborative effort of education and health care in the region to create a nursing program for bachelor's degree-seeking students.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the projects the College has recently implemented are a national advisory board program to help guide students in their majors, an alumni-student network, expanded hands-on experiential opportunities, and a student-run, nonprofit organization. \r\n\r\nPersonal Success Plans (PSPs) are created at freshman orientation and outline the progress that each student has selected to focus on in numerous areas. Both the student and the college assess progress each semester, making modifications as needed."

            "Denison University,  a small liberal arts college, is set in the proportionally small town of Granville, Ohio. From campus, students can walk to the restaurants and shops that line Granville’s main street. Bikers may enjoy the 36-mile trail that connects Granville to the nearby Ohio cities of Newark, Johnstown, and Alexandria. The state capital, Columbus, is about 25 miles away, and students can get there in the free Big Red Express shuttles, which run three days a week. All students must live on campus, unless they are married, have children, are over the age of 25, or commute from a nearby parent’s home. Freshmen will only live with other first-year students. Close to 30 percent of students are involved in Denison’s Greek system, which comprises about 15 fraternities and sororities. There are about 150 other student clubs and organizations on campus. Student athletes compete as the Denison Big Red in the NCAA Division III North Coast Athletic Conference, but the school does not have an official mascot, despite frequent attempts by students to find one. More than three quarters of students play sports at some level. Besides playing or cheering for sports teams, students can catch performances by famous musicians like Yo-Yo Ma in the Vail Series or get a quick cooking lesson from a faculty member during the on-campus Chowder Hours."

            "DePaul University is nationally recognized for its innovative, academically rigorous programs that combine applied learning with current theories to prepare students for their careers and their lives. Its pragmatic approach, which complements its partnerships with hundreds of Chicago organizations, draws accolades from guidebooks and employers. The only one of the nation???s ten largest private universities to make teaching its primary focus, DePaul provides a highly interactive learning environment through expert instruction and small class sizes. More than 98 percent of classes are taught by faculty members, not teaching assistants, while 86 percent of classes have 40 or fewer students. All full-time faculty members teach and those who teach graduate students also teach undergraduates. Many of the faculty members are nationally recognized in their field, yet they are accessible and approachable, taking an active interest in their students??? aspirations. Theory and experience are blended throughout the curriculum. Undergraduates master the application of classroom concepts through service-learning courses, research projects, internships, cooperative education and work-study programs. The Steans Center, one of a handful of endowed service-learning programs in the nation, coordinates courses that teach students while simultaneously helping more than 250 organizations throughout the metropolitan area. DePaul???s service-learning program is consistently ranked among the top 25 nationally. The service learning program is a key element of DePaul???s mission, which is to provide a high quality, values-based education to a wide range of students, with particular attention to first-generation students and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. The student body is diverse; about one third of all undergraduates are of color, including 36 percent of new freshmen, and about 35 percent are first-generation students from families where neither parent holds a college degree. DePaul maintains high standards for admission; 22 percent of incoming freshmen graduated in the top 10 percent of their class. About 30 percent of all freshmen are from outside Illinois. International students represent about 3 percent of the student body and come from more than 100 nations. This wide range of backgrounds and perspectives enables students to learn from each other through DePaul???s discussion- and project-oriented approach. As the nation's largest Catholic university, DePaul works to prepare its students to be ethically and socially engaged leaders in their chosen fields. DePaul is one of 62 universities nationwide, and the only one in Illinois, to qualify for the new Community Engagement citation given by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Its faculty and staff forge global and local educational partnerships impacting key ethical and social justice issues. It meshes seamlessly with Chicago???s commercial and artistic communities, offering its students unparalleled access to internships and learning opportunities with many of the nation???s top corporations and organizations as well as a rich array of cultural events and institutions. About one-third of DePaul???s full-time faculty members have consulted with corporations, agencies or organizations and more than half were involved in community service in the past year, staying current with industry practices. Students tap these connections for internships, mentors, class projects, professional contacts and more. Of DePaul???s 140,000 living alumni, more than 90,000 reside in the metropolitan area, providing students with a network locally and around the world."

            "Depauw University creates a supportive, insulated community for students in the rural, small town of Greencastle, Indiana. Every student must live on campus, whether in a traditional residence hall, Greek house, or on-campus apartment. Freshmen ease into college with the help of the Depauw Mentor Program, which assigns an upperclassman to guide about 15 first year students. Students with a specific career path in mind can enroll in the Management Fellows, Media Fellows, or Science Research Fellows Programs, which pair academics with semester-long internships and series of speakers. Depauw also has an Information Technology Associates Program for computer-minded students who wish to balance a liberal arts education with hands-on, paid technology work throughout campus. Depauw, which is affiliated with the United Methodist Church, operates on a schedule of two regular semesters and a four-week winter term, during which students can complete short internships, trips abroad, or on-campus coursework. After class, students can get involved in about 80 student organizations, and nearly 70 percent participate in Greek life. The Greek system, which has about 25 fraternities and sororities, has existed since 1845. The Depauw Tigers compete in the NCAA Division III Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference and share a longtime football rivalry with Wabash College. For a break from Greencastle, major cities like Indianapolis and Bloomington are less than an hour’s drive away."

            "Drew, a traditional small liberal arts college, combines the best of the classic liberal arts tradition with innovative programming across the curriculum, upholding the highest intellectual standards. Drew offers the full range of traditional majors in the liberal arts, along with several cutting-edge interdisciplinary and area-studies programs. Located on nearly 200 beautifully wooded acres known by students as \"the Forest\", Drew's campus is only 30 miles west of New York City, with convenient rail access. Students can take advantage of our location by participating in Drew programs in the city, including the Wall Street Semester, the Art Semester, and the United Nations Semester, all directed by Drew faculty. New programs include majors in Business Studies, and Environmental Studies and Sustainability along with a minor in Public Health. Many opportunities also exist for study abroad, including the unique and popular Drew International Seminars, a collection of three-week long international experiences aimed at sophomores, a semester-long program in London, and numerous summer programs for foreign languages like Italian and Spanish, all run by Drew's own faculty. Because of Drew's location, students benefit from extraordinary internship opportunities at corporate headquarters, research laboratories, foundations, charitable organizations, and government agencies. Drew's low student to faculty ratio and small class size enable its dedicated and accomplished faculty to develop close mentoring relationships with students. Drew seeks to promote diversity, civic engagement, and social responsibility both in and out of the classroom."

            "Students at Drexel University get a unique mix of in-class education and extensive on-the-job experience before graduation. Drexel operates a cooperative education program, sending students to more than 1,200 employers worldwide for six months at a time. Before graduation, students can complete as many as three co-ops, many of which are paid. (The average paycheck a Drexel student will take home after six months is more than $14,500.) To accommodate the co-ops, the university schedule is split into quarters. A co-op is completed over two quarters, and student who complete 3 co-ops will graduate in five years. Graduating in four years is possible if students opt for a single co-op experience and take classes during the summer. Most majors require students to complete at least one co-op. The experience pays off after graduation, as about a third of Drexel graduates are offered jobs by their co-op employers. When students aren’t working, there is plenty to do on the school’s main campus in Philadelphia’s University City. They have more than 160 student clubs and organizations to get involved in, including more than 25 fraternities and sororities. The Drexel Dragons compete in the NCAA Division I Colonial Athletic Conference. The neighborhood is extremely student centric, also home to the",

Drexel refers to itself as Philadelphia’s most technological school, and it was the first campus in the nation to be entirely wireless."

            "Earlham's international character makes it special. Internationalism is woven into the fabric of Earlham where classroom learning goes hand-in-hand with experiencing the diversity of the world. Earlham actively recruits students from across the United States and the world. Fifteen percent of Earlham's 1,200 undergraduates are international students. Students from Afghanistan and Palestine mix easily with those from Indiana, Pennsylvania, Oregon and more than 40 other states on Earlham's tree-lined east-central Indiana campus, where diversity is celebrated. Nearly 65 percent of Earlham students and 60 percent of the faculty have participated in study off-campus. As a part of the College's general education program, students complete an international diversity requirement, including proficiency in a second language. More than 200 courses throughout Earlham's curriculum include international themes and content.\r\n\r\nThe quality of Earlham's academic program is demonstrated by students' abilities to compete for and receive nationally competitive awards.  Earlham seniors have been very successful in achieving recognition through awards of national fellowships, such as the Thomas J. Watson Fellowship, the National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship, Fulbright Fellowships and others.  Earlham is one of only four liberal arts colleges that had a student place in the top 200 in the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition."

            "Eastern Mennonite University is a four-year Christian liberal arts institution guided by the Anabaptist peace-oriented tradition.  Located in Virginia's scenic Shenandoah Valley, EMU prepares students to serve and lead in a global context. Mennonite students account for about 50 percent enrollment, and more than 30 percent of EMU undergraduate students are children of EMU alumni. About 40 religious groups are represented on campus. Ethics, faith, and values are integrated into every course of study. Cross-cultural study -- usually a semester in another country -- and community service are required of all students. EMU offers 36 majors and 36 minors, a seminary, a Center for Justice and Peacebuilding, and graduate programs in conflict transformation, education, counseling and business administration.  EMU professors -- most of whom have lived internationally -- challenge students academically and mentor them to follow Christ's call to witness faithfully, serve compassionately, and walk boldly in the way of peace. Employers and graduate schools prefer EMU graduates because of the strong work ethic and moral integrity they offer.  EMU athletes compete in NCAA Division III sports. Regular chapel services and other worship gatherings are integral to EMU, where students receive support for their faith explorations.  Ministry assistants, community advisors and students in the graduate counseling program are part of the support network available to all students."

            "Eastern is a Christian University of the arts and sciences dedicated through teaching and learning, scholarship, spiritual formation, student development and community service to the preparation of undergraduate, graduate, and theological students for lives of faith, leadership and service. The \"Eastern Student Experience\" guided by that mission grows out of the University's commitment to interpretation and formation.  This intellectually curious and socially active community views and interprets the world through lenses ground from faith, reason and justice. Every course syllabus integrates those three elements in the learning experience. Student formation employs the same three integrated elements in preparing graduates for influential and ethical lives. Eastern is one of only a handful of universities in the world that incorporate all three in constructing a path to knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe unique value of a theory of knowledge and student development that is based on the synthesis of faith, reason and justice is evidenced clearly by Eastern students' activism. The SPEAK organization has recently moderated summer reconciliation talks between Catholic and Protestant students in Northern Ireland and between Latino youth gangs in Philadelphia. They also led an effort on campus that persuaded administration to make Eastern one of only eight campuses nationally to convert to 100% use of wind generated electricity. Another organization, Youth Against Complacency and Homelessness Today (YACHT Club), partners with Eastern alumni in the operation of two centers in Philadelphia that provide shelter, tutoring and temporary work for homeless families. A third group, Students In Free Enterprise (SIFE), teaches market economics and provides academic tutoring to high school students in two of Philadelphia's most economically challenged and violent neighborhoods. Students from Eastern's Templeton Honors College tutor elementary and middle school students from those same neighborhoods in science and mathematics. Graduate students in economic development work with World Vision and Habitat for Humanity in the third world, where Eastern graduates have helped generate more than 1 million new jobs over the last two decades. The Seminary's Sider Center for Ministry and Public Policy engages students for church-based community development activities in Camden, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nEastern operates Esperanza College, a bi-lingual junior college in north Philadelphia. After visiting that campus, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation invited Eastern to develop an Early College High School (ECHS) in the city. The ECHS model could prove to be a major breakthrough in urban teaching and learning. The research that Eastern faculty will generate from that work will be part of a comparatively large body of scholarship published by the university's teacher-scholar-activists. Eastern students have many opportunities to assist that research.\r\n\r\nClasses and justice activities combine with spiritual formation activities to develop students who love God and neighbor with heart, hands and mind. Along the way, Eastern students also have a great deal of fun. Ultimately, however, the university's unique mission is fulfilled when graduates influence the course of events in their communities and beyond after leaving Eastern."
